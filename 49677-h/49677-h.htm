<p class="cap">On the second day of July in the year
1863 the Civil War in America was
at its height. Late in the preceding month
Lee had turned his face northward, and,
with an army of a hundred thousand Confederate
soldiers at his back, had marched
up into Pennsylvania. There was little to
hinder his advance. Refraining, by reason
of strict orders, from wanton destruction
of property, his soldiers nevertheless lived
on the rich country through which they
passed. York and Carlisle were in their
grasp. Harrisburg was but a day’s march
away, and now, on this second day of July,
flushed with fresh victories, they had
turned and were giving desperate battle,
through the streets and on the hills of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Gettysburg, to the Union armies that had
followed them.</p>

<p>The old commonwealth was stirred as
she had not been stirred before since the
fall of Sumter. Every town and village in
the state responded quickly to the governor’s
call for emergency troops to defend
the capital city. Mount Hermon, already
depleted by generous early enlistments, and
by the draft of 1862, gathered together the
bulk of the able-bodied men left in the village
and its surroundings, and sent them
forth in defense of the commonwealth. Not
that Mount Hermon was in especial danger
from Lee’s invasion, far from it. Up in
the northeastern corner of the state, on a
plateau of one of the low foot-hills of the
Moosic range, sheltered by the mountains
at its back, it was well protected, both by
reason of distance and location, from the
advancing foe. But Mount Hermon was
intensely patriotic. In the days preceding
the Revolution the sturdy pioneers from
Connecticut had met the equally sturdy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
settlers from the domain of Penn, and on
this plateau they had fought out their contentions
and settled their differences; the
son of the Pennamite had married the
daughter of the Yankee; and the new race,
with love of country tingeing every drop of
its blood a deeper red, had stayed on and
possessed the land. So, on this July day,
when the armies of North and South were
striving and struggling with each other in
bloody combat back and forth across the
plain and up the hills of Gettysburg,
Mount Hermon’s heart beat fast. But it
was not for themselves that these people
were anxious. It was for the fathers,
husbands, sons, lovers in that army with
which Meade, untried and unproven, was
endeavoring to match the strategy and
strength of Lee. News of the first day’s
skirmishing had reached the village, and
it was felt that a great battle was imminent.
In the early evening, while the
women were still busy at their household
tasks, the men gathered at the post-office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and the stores, eager for late news,
anxious to discuss the situation as they
had learned it. In the meantime the boys
of the town had congregated on the village
green to resume the military drills
which, with more or less frequency, they
had carried on during the summer. These
drills were not wholly without serious intent.
It was play, indeed; but, out of the
ranks of these boys, three of the older ones
had already gone to the front to fight real
battles; and it was felt, by the men of the
town, that the boys could not be too
thoroughly imbued with the military spirit.
So, on this July evening, wakened into new
ardor by the news from Gettysburg, they
had gathered to resume their nightly work—and
play.</p>

<p>There were thirty-three of them, ranging
in years all the way from eight to eighteen.
They were eager and enthusiastic. And the
light of the low sun, shining red on their
faces, disclosed a spirit of earnestness
among them, as well as that appreciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of sport common to all American boys. At
the command to fall in there was much
pushing and jostling, much striving for
desirable places, and even the young captain,
with great show of authority, could
not quite adjust all differences to the complete
satisfaction of his men.</p>

<p>Before the confusion had wholly ceased,
and while there were still awkward gaps in
the ranks, a tall, straight, shy-mannered boy
of seventeen, who had remained hitherto
on the outskirts of the group, quietly
slipped into one of the vacant places.</p>

<p>The ranks being finally formed, the orderly
sergeant stepped out in front of the
company to call the roll. By some inadvertence
he had lost or mislaid his list of
names, and for the moment he was at a loss
what to do. But his quick wit came to his
rescue, and, beginning at the right of the
line, he called the names of those who were
under his eye.</p>

<p>“Albright!”</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Valentine!”</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>“Bannister!”</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>It was the tall straight boy who had
slipped quietly into the ranks who responded
to this last name. Down the line
there went a little murmur of surprise, and
before the sergeant could call the next
name, one of his soldiers stepped one pace
to the front and struck his hand violently
against his breast.</p>

<p>The astonished sergeant ceased suddenly
to call the roll.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, Sam?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“I want to know,” said Sam, resentment
ringing in his voice, “what right Bob Bannister
has to be in this company.”</p>

<p>“Why ain’t he got a right?” responded
the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Because he’s a traitor,” replied the indignant
Sam.</p>

<p>“And his father’s a copperhead,” added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
another fledgeling soldier, stepping also
one pace to the front. Then came from the
ranks generally a chorus of protest against
the admission of the tall straight youth to
the privileges of the drill.</p>

<p>The sergeant, turning appealingly to the
captain, who was standing with folded
arms at some little distance, said deprecatingly:
“It’s none o’ my business. All I
got to do is to call the roll. I don’t muster
’em in.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the captain, fifteen years of
age, took the matter up.</p>

<p>“Let private Bannister step to the front,”
he commanded.</p>

<p>The accused boy fell out of the rear
rank, passed to the left of the line, and so on
to the front.</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself, Bob,” he said.
“You’re charged with being a traitor.”</p>

<p>“It’s not true,” replied the boy quietly
but firmly, his face flushing and paling by
turns.</p>

<p>“Well, what about your father?” cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Sam. “Ain’t he said ’t this war’s a failure
and ’t Abe Lincoln’s a fraud?”</p>

<p>“An’ ain’t he the biggest copperhead in
Mount Hermon township?” piped up a
small boy on the extreme left.</p>

<p>Whereupon there was another chorus
of denunciation, and a half-dozen boys
shouted at once: “We don’t want any son
of a copperhead in this company!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you fellows!” exclaimed the
captain, “or I’ll have every mother’s son of
you arrested for breach of discipline, an’
shut you up in the guard-house on bread
an’ water, every one of you. Now, let’s get
at this thing orderly. We’ll give Bob a fair
hearing an’ then decide whether we want
him or not.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Sam, “le’s court-martial
’im. That’s the way to settle his hash.”</p>

<p>The idea of court-martialing the objectionable
applicant for military privileges
met with instant approval on the part of the
company. Whereupon the captain at once
made his appointments for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“You, Brilly—Lieutenant Brill, you be
judge-advocate general; you, Sergeant
Davis and Corporal Guild, you be assistant
judge-advocate general; you, Sam Powers,
you be prosecuting attorney, and you, Private
Grimstone, you defend the prisoner.
All three of you sit down on the bench
under this tree an’ hear the witnesses.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks!” exclaimed a disgusted
youth, leaving the ranks and walking away.
“You fellows are too smart. If you don’t
want ’im, kick ’im out an’ done with it, an’
you’ll kick out the best soldier in the company.
Court-martial snakes! Aw, shucks!”</p>

<p>“You, Bill Hinkle,” retorted the captain,
“you’re discharged in disgrace for insubordination.
Now, boys, come on. Oh,
I forgot! Break ranks, march!”</p>

<p>But the ranks were already broken beyond
immediate repair, and the crowd
surged toward the bench on which the members
of the military trial court were already
seated. Witnesses were at once called to
prove what every one knew, that Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Bannister’s father was an open sympathizer
with the South, that he had declared
the war to be a mistake and a failure and
Abraham Lincoln to be a fraud. Then
Bob’s lawyer called for witnesses to come
to Bob’s defense; but no one came. His
cause was too unpopular. So the attorney
called on Bob himself.</p>

<p>“Now you just stand up here,” he said,
“before these judges, an’ make a clean
breast o’ the whole business, an’ throw
yourself on the mercy of this honorable
court; an’ don’t you tell no lies because we
won’t have it; do you hear?”</p>

<p>Thus commanded by his own counsel,
Bob stood up to face his accusers. Although
he was one of the oldest boys present,
and capable, both by reason of his
bigness and his mental ability, of being their
leader, yet his natural diffidence and his
unfortunate paternal connection had kept
him in the background during the entire
course of the war. In this mock trial he
saw no humor. To him it was very real and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of much moment. He felt that the time was
come when he should either be vindicated
as a loyal citizen, fit to associate with his
fellows, or else shut out permanently from
their companionship. His face was very
pale as he began to speak, his dark eyes
were suffused with emotion, and a stray
lock of his black hair hung damp across his
forehead.</p>

<p><a href="#image02">“I’m no traitor,”</a> he began. “It’s not
right to call me a traitor. And I’m no
copperhead either. I believe in the war. I
believe in Abraham Lincoln, and I—I
love the flag.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_11">“I’M NO TRAITOR.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>He turned his eyes up toward the stars
and stripes drooping lazily from the summit
of the great pole planted on the village
green.</p>

<p>“Well, ain’t your father a copperhead?”
asked the prosecuting lawyer savagely.
“An’ ain’t he talked ag’inst Lincoln, an’
ag’inst the soldiers, an’ ag’inst the war, an’
ag’inst the govament, an’ ag’inst—ag’inst
the whole business? Ain’t he? An’ ain’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
you his son, an’ ain’t you got to mind him?
An’ don’t you believe he tells the truth?
Do you s’pose your father’d lie? Answer
me that now. Do you think he’d lie?”</p>

<p>The prosecuting attorney turned toward
his auditors with a smile and a nod, as
much as to say: “That’s a clincher, I’ve
got him now.”</p>

<p>But by this time Bob’s diffidence had
disappeared. The under part of his nature
was roused and ready to assert itself. He
lifted his head, and his eyes sparkled as he
looked around him.</p>

<p>“My father is no liar,” he replied. “He
says what he believes to be true about the
war. Maybe he’s mistaken. That’s not
for me to say, nor for you. But so far as
I’m concerned, I tell you again that I’m
loyal. I stand by the President, and by the
government, and by the flag; and some day
I’ll fight for it, and I’ll do things for it that
you, Sam Powers, and you, Jim Brill, and
all the rest of you wouldn’t dare to do.”</p>

<p>He stood erect, with flushed face and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
flashing eyes, and for a brief moment his
accusers were silent. Then, gently at first,
but increasing soon to a storm of protest,
the voices of his companions were heard in
reply. In the midst of the confusion the
judge-advocate general held up his hand
for silence.</p>

<p>“It appears to the court”—he began,
but a voice interrupted him:—</p>

<p>“Question! Put the question!”</p>

<p>With little knowledge of parliamentary
rules, and still less of proceedings before a
court-martial, the judge-advocate general
and his associates looked a trifle dazed.</p>

<p>“Question! I call for the question,” demanded
the person with insistent voice.
“Shall Bob Bannister be allowed to be a
member of this company?”</p>

<p>The judge-advocate general pulled himself
together and slowly repeated the question:—</p>

<p>“Shall Bob Bannister be allowed to be a
member of this company? All you that
want him say Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Three feeble and uncertain voices responded
in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“And all you that don’t want him say
No.”</p>

<p>The chorus of noes was triumphantly
loud.</p>

<p>“The noes win,” declared the judge-advocate
general; and the captain added,
“The court’s adjourned sign dee.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks!” exclaimed Bill Hinkle,
now in disgrace himself and therefore more
in sympathy with Bob. “You fellows
know a lot, don’t you! You’re smart, ain’t
you! W’y, Bob Bannister’s the best man
you got. I’ll back him to lick any three of
you, with one hand tied behind ’is back, by
jimminy! You’ve made regular nincompoops
o’ yourselves, you have. Aw, shucks!”</p>

<p>And the deeply and doubly disgusted
one walked away.</p>

<p>So did Bob Bannister walk away. He
went with bent head and breaking heart.
To be denied the right to join with his companions
in any demonstration looking to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
country’s glory or welfare was, to him, a
tragedy. His was one of those natures endowed
at birth with a spirit of patriotism.
From the time when he could first read he
had absorbed the history of his country and
her heroes. No colors had ever shone before
his eyes more brilliant and beautiful
than the red, white, and blue of his country’s
flag. With an intuition far beyond his
years, he had grasped the meaning and
foreseen the consequences of a dissolution
of the compact that bound the states together.
And when, at last, the storm broke,
when Sumter fell, when Bull Run came,
an awakening calamity, he threw his whole
heart and soul into the cause of the North,
and from that time on he lived in spirit,
and would have died in body, with the
Union armies, fighting, that the old flag
and all that it symbolized might prevail.
Yet, strange as it may seem, his father, with
whom he lived, of whom he was proud and
fond, to whom he was loyally obedient,
was an outspoken sympathizer with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Southern Confederacy. Perhaps it was the
strain of Southern blood in his veins, perhaps
it was the underlying aristocracy of
feeling of those whose ancestors have
owned slaves, perhaps it was the clear logic
of his mind running in the narrow grooves
that genius so often hollows out, that led
Rhett Bannister into his passionate sympathy
with the South. Be that as it may,
he was no coward. What he was, what he
felt, what he thought, was known of all
men. Opposition could not conquer him,
opprobrious epithets could not cow him,
nor could ostracism silence his eloquent
tongue.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the general and fervent
loyalty of the community in which Bannister
lived, there were, nevertheless, among
the people, those who felt that the war was
a mistake and a failure, that the issue had
been tried out at an awful sacrifice with but
indifferent success, and that now peace
should be had on any reasonable terms.
These were the conservatives, the locofocos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Then there were those who, deeply
sympathizing with the South from the
beginning of the trouble, were ready to
make any legal opposition to a further
prosecution of the war by the Federal government,
using politics and public speech
as their strongest weapons. These were
classed in the North as copperheads. Then
there were still others who, saying little and
clothing their conduct with secrecy, gave
what aid, comfort, and active coöperation
they could to the enemies of the Federal
government. These were plainly spoken of
as traitors. Indeed, secret organizations
sprang up in the North and West, with their
lodges, officers, grips, and passwords, having
for their object a concentrated effort to
undermine the patriotic efforts of the citizens
of the North and the administration at
Washington, and to aid indirectly in the
defeat of the Union armies in the field.
Perhaps the most deeply rooted organization
of the kind in the loyal states was
known as the Knights of the Golden Circle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
But Rhett Bannister was not one of their
members. He despised the stab in the dark,
and all secret and unfair methods of warfare.
Frank, eloquent, and outspoken, he
never hesitated to say and to do freely and
openly that which he deemed to be right,
regardless of the opinions, the condemnation,
or even the hate of his neighbors.</p>

<p>It was to this father and to his home that
the boy, refused admission into the patriotic
ranks of his comrades, now started on his
way. At the edge of the village he met
Sarah Jane Stark. There are some people
who are always known, not only to their
friends but to the public also, by their full
names. Sarah Jane Stark was one of them.
She had lived in Mount Hermon all her
life. How long that was it would be ungallant
to say, had not Miss Stark herself declared
boastfully that she had come within
fifteen years of living in two centuries. With
no children of her own, she was a mother
to all the children in the village. Kind-hearted,
sharp-tongued, a terror to evil-doers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
“a very present help in trouble” to
all the worthy who needed her assistance,
the social arbiter of the town, she was the
most loved as well as the most feared woman
in the community. When she met
Bob in the footpath at the roadside, she
looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>“Look here, Bob Bannister,” she said,
“you’ve been crying. Or if you haven’t,
you’ve been so close to it there wasn’t any
fun in it. Now you just go ahead and tell
me what the matter is.”</p>

<p>Bob knew from previous experience, on
many occasions, that it was absolutely useless
to attempt evasion with Sarah Jane
Stark. Much as his sensitive nature rebelled
against complaining of any slight
that his fellows had put upon him, he felt
that he must make a clean breast of it to
his questioner.</p>

<p>“Why, they put me out of the company,
Miss Stark,” he said. “I wanted to drill in
the company with the other fellows and
they wouldn’t let me. That’s all. I s’pose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
they had a right to do it; of course they had
a right.”</p>

<p>“Put you out of the company, did they?
And what did they put you out for, I’d like
to know? Aren’t you as good a soldier as
any of them?”</p>

<p>“Well, that wasn’t exactly it, Miss
Stark. They seemed to think that because—well,
they thought I wasn’t loyal.”</p>

<p>“Thought you weren’t loyal! Well, that
is a note! Why, you—oh, I see! On account
of your father, eh? Yes, I see.”</p>

<p>Miss Stark tapped her foot impatiently
on the hard soil of the side-path, and looked
off toward the blue sky-line of the Moosic
range, behind which the sun had already
gone down.</p>

<p>“‘The sins of the fathers shall be visited
upon the children,’” she said musingly.
Then she turned again to Bob.</p>

<p>“You’re no copperhead yourself, are
you?” she inquired. “You’re not even a
locofoco, are you?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Miss Stark! There isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
one of those boys that believes in putting
down the rebellion more than I do, that
loves the old flag more than I do, or would
fight for it, or for the government, or for
Abraham Lincoln, quicker than I would if
I had the chance—Miss Stark, I’m loyal,
I’m loyal!”</p>

<p>He stood erect, eyes flashing, the color
back in his cheeks, the soul within him
speaking. Sarah Jane Stark went up to
him and put her arm about his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Good!” she cried. “You’re the right
sort. I wish Abe Lincoln had a hundred
thousand at the front just like you. Now
you leave that matter about the company
to me. I’ll see those boys, the little brats,
and if they don’t take you in I’ll—”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Stark, please don’t! I couldn’t
go back in now. I couldn’t ever go in
after this. But if the war lasts till I get old
enough, I shall be a real soldier in a real
company some day.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you!”</p>

<p>It was not a very dignified nor refined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
expression; but Sarah Jane Stark was noted
for expressing herself forcibly when the
occasion demanded it, and she felt that this
was one of the occasions that demanded it.</p>

<p>“And,” she added, “you go tell Rhett
Bannister for me, that if he had one thousandth
part of the natural patriotism and
horse-sense of his son— No, you needn’t
tell him; I’ll tell him myself. I can do it
better. You just trot along home and don’t
let the conduct of those fool boys trouble
you. You’re right and they’re wrong, and
that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>So Bob went on his way. The Bannister
home lay on the old North and South turnpike
road, a full mile from the centre of the
village. A very comfortable home it was,
too, neat and prosperous in appearance,
with a small and fertile farm behind the
commodious house, and a well-kept lawn
in front. For Rhett Bannister, theorist
though he was, was no mere dreamer of
dreams, he was a worker as well; both the
fruit of his brain and the labor of his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
being evident in the comforts by which he
was surrounded.</p>

<p>When Bob went up the path to the
porch he found his father and mother and
his six-year-old sister all there, enjoying the
coolness of the evening. It was already too
dark for either of his parents to discover in
Bob’s face any sign of distress, and he did
not mention to them his experiences of the
evening. But the quick ear of his mother
caught the troubled cadence in his voice,
and she went over and sat by him and began
smoothing the hair back from his forehead.</p>

<p>“You’re tired, Robbie,” she said, “and
it’s been such a warm day.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything new up town
about the Pennsylvania raid?” inquired his
father.</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” replied the boy. “I
believe there’s been some fighting around
Gettysburg, and they’re expecting a big
battle there to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the man, “I suppose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
two armies are facing each other there,
very likely the slaughter has already begun.
Perhaps there’ll be another holocaust like
Fredericksburg. Doubtless thousands of
lives will be sacrificed and millions of money
squandered at Gettysburg, when ten words
from the stiff-necked incompetents at Washington
would have stopped the horrible conflict
and brought peace to the country
months ago.”</p>

<p>Bob said nothing, he knew it was useless.
He had, on two or three occasions, attempted
in a feeble way to argue with his
father questions pertaining to the war, but
he had been fairly swept off his feet by a
flood of logic and eloquence, and he had
found silence on these matters to be the
better part for him to take in the presence
of his father.</p>

<p>After a few minutes the man added: “If,
even now, Lincoln would concede one half
of what the South demands as a plain
right—”</p>

<p>Bannister paused. Somewhere in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
darkness up the road there was a confused
sound of voices. Then, from a score of
lusty young throats there came in on the
still air of the summer night the familiar
words of a patriotic song.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“My country, ’tis of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sweet land of liberty—”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“It sounds good, Robert,” said Rhett
Bannister. “But what’s it all about?
What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, father,” said Bob; “I—I
guess it’s just the boys a-marching.”</p>

<p>The voices and the words of the song
grew clearer and more distinct. Now the
steady tramp of marching feet could be
distinguished. Then another song broke in
upon the night.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in the grave;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in the grave;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in the grave;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But his soul goes marching on.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Loud, clear, and musical came the
“Glory, glory, hallelujah!” chorus; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
indistinctly in the darkness, the figures of
the marching company could be discerned,
coming down the road in front of the lawn.</p>

<p>The expression on Rhett Bannister’s face
could not be seen, but his voice was heavy
with indignation as he muttered:—</p>

<p>“And that same John Brown was a fanatic,
a fool, and a murderer, and richly
deserved his fate.”</p>

<p>“They don’t know, father,” said Bob
apologetically. “They sing it because it
sounds good.”</p>

<p>Down by the gate there was, for a moment,
an ominous silence, then, full-volumed
and vigorous, a new parody on “John
Brown’s Body” was hurled across the
darkness toward the house of the copperhead.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“We’ll hang Rhett Ban’ster on a sour-apple tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We’ll hang Rhett Ban’ster on a sour-apple tree;<br /></span>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>NEWS FROM GETTYSBURG</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">At the first line of the daring parody
Rhett Bannister and his son both
sprang to their feet, the one white with
sudden rage, the other stricken with indignation
and alarm. With one step the man
reached the edge of the porch, with the
next he was down on the path on his way to
the gate, to give physical expression to his
wrath. What would have happened in the
road can only be conjectured, had not Bob’s
frightened little mother run to the porch-steps
and called to her husband:—</p>

<p>“Rhett, dear! Rhett, don’t! Don’t
mind them. Come back, Rhett, dear!”</p>

<p>The angry man stopped in his headlong
passage down the walk. There had never
been a time in all his married life when the
pleading voice of his wife had not been sufficient
to check any outburst of passion on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
his part. Daring and defiant to all the
world beside when occasion prompted him,
he had always been as tender and gentle
with her as in the days of their courtship.
She was down at his side now, one hand on
his arm, trying to soothe his outraged feelings.</p>

<p>“They’re mere boys, Rhett. They don’t
know any better. Some day, when they’re
older, they’ll regret it. And now you’ll have
nothing to regret, Rhett, dear, nothing.”</p>

<p>Up from the road came a defiant shout:</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Abe Lincoln!”</p>

<p>“Down with the copperheads!”</p>

<p>But, even at the height of his rage, with
the taunts and threats of his tormentors
ringing in his ears, Rhett Bannister turned
and took pity on his wife, and led her back
to the porch with reassuring words. The
unterrified boys, taking up again their line
of march, turned into the crossroad on their
way back to the village, singing:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cheer up, comrades, they will come.”<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>“I suppose it isn’t worth while,” said the
man, seating himself on the porch-steps
and wiping the perspiration from his forehead.
“The boys are not so much to blame.
It’s their parents who instill into their
minds that spirit of intolerance, who deserve
to be chastened. Now you can see,
Robert,” turning to the boy, “the extremes
to which the Northern adherents of Lincoln’s
cause carry their hate for those who
will not agree with them.”</p>

<p>“I know, father, I know. It’s an outrage.
They have treated me even worse than they
have you. And yet—and yet I can’t believe
Lincoln is to blame for it.”</p>

<p>For once the defense of Lincoln did not
arouse Bannister’s ire. He was too deeply
interested in what the boy had said of himself.</p>

<p>“And how have they treated you, Robert?
What have they done to you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much. Only they say
you’re a copperhead, and they—they—”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“They think I must be a copperhead,
too.”</p>

<p>“So! Well, it’s not a pretty name, to be
sure, but it stands for something in these
days. And suppose you were a copperhead,
what then?”</p>

<p>“But I’m not. And that’s how they hurt
me.”</p>

<p>“What have they done to you, Robert?
What have they said to you? How have
they hurt you? I want to know.”</p>

<p>The pitch of anger was back in the man’s
voice. He could stand persecution for himself,
but to have his loved ones persecuted,
that was unbearable.</p>

<p>“Oh, it don’t amount to much,” replied
the boy; “they simply didn’t want me,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t want you when? where? how?
Tell me, Robert! I say, tell me!”</p>

<p>It was the last thing the boy would have
told to his father voluntarily, the story of
the slight put upon him that evening at the
village. But, inadvertently, he had stumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
into the mention of it, and now there was
no escape from telling the whole story. He
had never learned the art of equivocation,
and it did not take many questionings before
the whole humiliating tale was in his
father’s possession. But the outburst of
wrath that the boy had feared did not come.
Instead, for many minutes, the man sat
silent, looking down at the gray footpath
losing itself in the shadows of the trees.
When at last he raised his head, he spoke
slowly as if to himself.</p>

<p>“Poor, weak, wicked human nature!
Poor, paltry, fluctuating popular sentiment!
Utterly illogical, brutally oppressive, with
no mind nor thought of its own, led hither
and thither by charlatans and demagogues
‘clothed with a little brief authority.’ Ah!
but those men who rule and ruin down
there at Washington will have much to
answer for some day! It may not be until
the last great day, but the accounting is
bound to come. Mary,” turning to his
wife, “is it better that we should follow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
lead of our own minds and consciences,
and suffer humiliation and insult and ostracism;
or shall we yield to popular pressure,
and hide our sentiments, and go along with
the shouting, cheering, mindless rabble, and
shout and cheer with them?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Rhett, dear. I don’t
know anything about it. I try to think it
out sometimes, but I get all confused and
I stop trying. You know Cousin Henry is
fighting with Lee, and Cousin Charley is
with Grant in Mississippi. So many Kentucky
families are divided that way, and it
isn’t strange that I should be at a loss
to decide. But you’ve thought it all out,
Rhett, and you must be right, and I’ll
think just as you do, no matter what happens
to us. Anyway, so long as I have you
and Robert and Louise I shall try to be
happy. Where is Louise? I forgot all about
her. Louise!”</p>

<p>“Here, mother.”</p>

<p>The child had retreated to the corner of
the porch when the first sign of trouble appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and, now that the excitement was
over, she was tired and sleepy.</p>

<p>“Come, dearie, it’s long past bedtime.
Say good-night to papa and Robert.”</p>

<p>After that, though Bob and his father
sat long upon the porch, there was no resumption
of conversation. Each was immersed
in thought, each was depressed in
spirit, and each went to his bed only to
pass a restless and troubled night.</p>

<p>The next day but one was the Fourth of
July. Early in the morning there came
down to the Bannister homestead the dull
echo of the firing of the little old village heirloom
of a cannon, which the boys had
dragged up to the top of a ledge back of the
town, and with which they were accustomed,
on Independence Day, to rouse their
sleeping neighbors. There was to be a celebration
at the village, of course. There had
been a celebration on the Fourth of July
at Mount Hermon from a time whereof
the memory of the oldest inhabitant ran
not to the contrary. There were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
speeches, the band was to play, the glee
club was to sing. All day, in the basement
of the town hall, the young ladies were to
sell refreshments and fireworks for the
benefit of the Soldiers’ Relief Fund.</p>

<p>Yet there was no spirit of cheerfulness
or rejoicing in the air. The times were too
tense. The strain of conflict was too great.
The mightiest battle of the Civil War was
on at Gettysburg. For two days, across
the streets and up the heights of that quaint
Pennsylvania village, the armies of Meade
and Lee had clashed and striven with each
other, until the uncovered dead lay by
ghastly thousands, and every hollow in the
hillside held its pool of blood. Rumors of
victory and rumors of disaster crossed and
recrossed each other on the way from the
battle-field to the villages of the North.
Mount Hermon hardly knew what to believe.
She was positive only of this: that
two score of her sons were down there in
the Army of the Potomac, and that in all
human probability some of them, many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
them indeed, were wounded, dying, dead.
Whose husband, son, brother, lover would
it prove to be, whose eyes would never see
Mount Hermon’s elms again? No wonder
the spirit of anxiety and fearfulness outweighed
that of jubilant patriotism on this
day.</p>

<p>All the morning the news had been sifting
little by little into the village. Toward
noon it was certain that out of the stress
and horror of a mighty battle had come
distinct victory for the Union armies. Lee
was crushed, there was no doubt of that.
His broken ranks were already in retreat,
that too was well assured. From some
quarter also came a rumor that Grant, who
had been for weeks thundering at the gates
of Vicksburg, had broken them down at
last, had occupied the city, and that Pemberton’s
army was his. Yet Mount Hermon
did no loud rejoicing. She waited
impatiently for confirmation of the news,
anxiously for the list of dead and wounded.
At two o’clock the stage would come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bringing the mail and the morning papers.
As the hour approached, the crowd about
the post-office grew greater. Not a jubilant
crowd, just a waiting, hoping, fearing, intensely
earnest concourse of the people of
Mount Hermon.</p>

<p>Into this gathering strode Rhett Bannister.
It was imprudent and foolhardy for
him to come, and he should have known it.
Indeed, he did know it. But during the two
nights and a day that had passed since the
slight put on his boy, since the sons of his
neighbors had insulted him at his own home,
he had thought much. And the more he
thought, the more deeply wounded became
his pride, the more restlessly he chafed
under the humiliating yoke that had been
forced on him, the more defiantly he determined
to assert his right to think for himself
and to express such opinions as he saw
fit concerning public affairs. He felt that
he was as much of a patriot, that he had
the interest of his country as deeply at heart
as any resident of Mount Hermon. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
then should he submit tamely to humiliation
and ostracism and maltreatment? And
if he chose to go where he had a right to go,
on the highway, through the village streets,
to the government post-office, to the public
gathering in celebration of a day which was
as dear to his heart as to the heart of any
citizen of the town, why in the name of
liberty should he not go? Let the rabble
say what they would, he felt that he could
defend himself, by word of mouth, with his
strong right arm, if necessary, against any
blatant demagogue or blind political partisan
who might choose to set upon him. In
this frame of mind he started for the village,
and in this frame of mind he strode into
that group of tense, anxious, patriotic men
and women waiting for the news.</p>

<p>There were few who greeted him as he
pushed his way to the post-office window,
and called for his mail. The postmaster
handed out to him two papers and a letter.
He tore off the end of the envelope, drew
out the scrap of paper which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
inclosed, and looked at it. Then his face
turned red with anger. Some mischievous,
malicious busybody had sent him an anonymous
epistle: a crudely penciled picture, a
libelous scrawl beneath it, the whole a coarse
thrust at his alleged disloyalty. If this had
been intended as a joke, he could not have
taken it as such. But it was no joke. To
him, indeed, it was simply a coarse, brutal,
wanton attack on his manhood and patriotism.
It started the fires of rage burning
with sevenfold heat in his heart. He lifted
his blazing eyes to find half the people in
the little room staring at him, some wonderingly,
some exultingly. Out by the doorway
there was a suppressed chuckle. No
one spoke. If Bannister had been content
to hold his peace, there would have been
no trouble. But he could not do that. Only
death could have sealed his lips in that
moment. He held up the coarse cartoon,
with its equally coarse inscription, for the
crowd to look at. Then he said, speaking
deliberately:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“I observe that you have found a new
way to fight the battles of your alleged
country.”</p>

<p>For a moment no one replied. Then,
from the farther side of the room came the
voice of Sergeant Goodman, home on furlough,
wounded.</p>

<p>“To whom are you speaking, Rhett
Bannister?”</p>

<p>And the reply came, hot and swift:—</p>

<p>“To the coward who sent me this work
of art; to you who aided and abetted him,
and to all of you who take your cue from
the Federal government at Washington,
and persecute in every mean and malicious
way those who do not believe in wholesale
murder in the South and who are not afraid
to say so in the North.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about your letter
and picture, Bannister,” said the sergeant,
“but we who are doing the fighting believe
in the Federal government at Washington,
we believe that we are carrying on a just
war, and we believe that if it were not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
you and the rest of your backbiting, disloyal,
copperhead crew here in the North,
who are giving aid and sympathy to the
rebels of the South, we would have had
this war ended a year ago.”</p>

<p>“Give it to him, sergeant!” cried an enthusiastic
listener; “let him understand
that it ain’t healthy for traitors around
here.”</p>

<p>“I’m no traitor,” responded Bannister
hotly. “I think as much of my country
as you do of yours. I’ll give more to-day,
in proportion to my means, to secure an
honorable peace between North and South
than any other man in this room.”</p>

<p>“Hon’able peace!” shouted a gray-haired
man indignantly. “Dishon’able surrender
you mean. You want the govament to back
down, don’t ye, an’ acknowledge the corn,
an’ let Jeff Davis hev his own way, an’
make a present to ’em o’ the hull South an’
half the North to boot, don’t ye? An’ tell
’em they done right to shoot down the ol’
flag on Fort Sumter, an’ tell ’em ’at Abe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Lincoln’s a fool an’ a fraud an’ a murderer,
don’t ye? don’t ye?”</p>

<p>“That estimate of Abraham Lincoln is
not far from right, my friend,” replied Bannister.
“For it is only a fool and a knave,
and a man with the spirit of Cain in his
heart, that would plunge his country into
ruin and keep her there; that would send
you, Sergeant Goodman, and you, Henry
Bradbury, and all of us who may be drawn
in the accursed conscription that is coming,
down to slaughter, without cause, our
brothers of the South.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Rhett Bannister!”</p>

<p>This was the voice of Henry Bradbury.
He stood against the wall with an empty
sleeve hanging at his side, telling mutely
of Antietam and Libby. “You can’t talk
that way about Abe Lincoln here. We
don’t want to hurt you, but there’s some
of us who’ve been in the army, an’ who love
old Abe, an’ who won’t stand an’ hear him
slandered; do you hear!”</p>

<p>“Oh, lynch him!” yelled a shrill voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
“Lynch him, an’ have done with it. He
deserves it!”</p>

<p>“No, tar an’ feather him an’ send him
where Old Abe sent Vallandigham, down
among his rebel friends!” cried another.</p>

<p>People were crowding into the little lobby
of the post-office, attracted by the sound
of angry voices, curious to see and hear,
ready for any sensation that might befall.
Up near the box-window, white with anger,
not with fear, stood Rhett Bannister with
clenched hands. In front of him were a
score of indignant men, ready at the next
instant, if wrought to it, to do him bodily
harm.</p>

<p>Then old Jeremiah Holloway, the postmaster,
puffing and perspiring with his three
hundred pounds, came out from his side
door and rapped against the wall with his
cane.</p>

<p>“This won’t do, gentlemen!” he said. “I
can’t have a riot in a govament post-office.
You’ll have to git outside an’ have your
fun if you want it. I ain’t protectin’ no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
copperheads. But I’m goin’ to protect my
property an’ Uncle Sam’s if I have to
knock down every one of you. Besides,
the stage’s a-comin’ an’ you got to make
way for the United States mail.”</p>

<p>Holloway’s appeal for the protection of
his property might or might not have had
the desired effect, but his announcement of
the arrival of the stage called the attention
of the crowd to the approach of a four-horse
vehicle, already half-way down the
square, and people surged out to meet it.
For by the stage came papers, letters from
the seat of war, sometimes soldiers on
furlough, and this afternoon it brought also
the speaker of the day, an eloquent young
lawyer from the county town, who had already
seen service at the front. The band
struck up a patriotic air and marched,
playing, across to the platform on the green,
followed by the girls and boys. The older
people remained at the post-office to get
their mail. Passengers by stage confirmed
the news of the victory at Gettysburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
hotly fought for, dearly bought, but a victory
nevertheless. They also brought more
definite rumors of Grant’s probable success
at Vicksburg. The letters were distributed
and delivered. There were few from the
front. The boys who were with Meade had
had no opportunity to write that week.
But the newspapers were already in the
hands of eager readers, men with pale
faces, women with pounding hearts.</p>

<p>“Listen to this!” said Adam Johns, the
schoolmaster. “Here’s what the <cite>Tribune</cite>
says: ‘Pickett’s division of Longstreet’s
corps crossed the plain in splendid marching
order, driving our skirmishers before
them. At the Emmitsburg road they met
the first serious resistance. But they stormed
the stone fence which formed our barricade,
and swept on up the hill under a galling fire
from our rifles in front and our artillery
on their flank, closing in and marching
over their thousands of fallen, up into and
over our shallow rifle-pits, overpowering
our troops, not only by the momentum, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
as well by the daring of their desperate
charge. And that charge was met by resistance
just as stubborn, by bravery as
great, by daring as magnificent. From this
moment the fighting was terrible. They
were on our guns, bayoneting our gunners,
waving their flags above our pieces, yelling
the victory they believed they had won.
But now came the crisis. They had gone
too far, they had penetrated too deeply into
our lines. They had exposed themselves
to a storm of grape and canister from our
guns on the western slope of Cemetery
Hill, and, Pettigrew’s supporting division
having broken and fled, our flanking columns
began to close in on their rear. Then
came twenty minutes of the bloodiest fighting
of the war. Gaylord’s regiment of
Pennsylvania farmers struck Pickett’s extreme
left and doubled and crushed it in
a fierce encounter. But it was done at an
awful sacrifice. Brackett’s company alone
lost twenty-three of its men, and every sergeant,
and Brackett himself was killed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a hand-to-hand encounter with a rebel
rifleman—’”</p>

<p>The reader paused, lifted his eyes, and
looked fearfully around the little room,
peering into the strained faces turned
toward him.</p>

<p>“She ain’t here,” said a voice from the
crowd.</p>

<p>“God help Martha Brackett!” added
another.</p>

<p>But there was a woman there, poorly
dressed, pale and shrunken from recent
illness, scanning, with dreading eyes, the
lists of dead, wounded, missing, with which
columns of the paper some one had given
her were filled. In the midst of the confusion
of voices following the announcement
of Brackett’s heroic charge and fall, there
was a shrill scream, the paper fell from the
nerveless hand of the woman in poor
clothes, and she fell, white and insensible,
to the floor.</p>

<p>“She saw her boy’s name in the list of
killed,” said one who had been looking over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
her shoulder as she read. Others lifted the
poor, limp body and carried the stricken
woman into the fresh air to await her sad
return to consciousness.</p>

<p>And all this time Rhett Bannister, standing
defiantly in his corner, holding his peace,
watching the grim tragedies that were being
enacted around him, dread echoes of that
mighty tragedy of battle, felt the surging
tide of indignation rising higher and higher
in his breast, until, at last, unable longer
to keep rein on his tongue, he cried out:—</p>

<p>“I charge Abraham Lincoln and the
Abolition leaders at Washington with the
death of George Brackett and the murder
of Jennie Lebarrow’s son!”</p>

<p>Then, Sergeant Goodman, home on furlough,
wounded, strode forth and grasped
the collar of Bannister’s coat, and before
he could shake himself free, or defend himself
in any way, others had seized his hands,
and bound his wrists together behind his
back, and then they led him forth, helpless,
mute with unspeakable rage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“What shall we do with him?” asked
one.</p>

<p>“Rush him to the platform!” cried another.</p>

<p>And almost before he knew it, Bannister
had been tossed up on the speaker’s stand
and thrown into a chair, and was being held
there, an object of execration to the crowd
that surrounded him. He was not cowed
or frightened. But he was dumb with indignation
that his rights and his person
had been so shamelessly outraged. White-faced,
hatless, with torn coat and disheveled
hair, he sat there breathing hate
and looking defiance at his captors and tormentors.</p>

<p>“If this had been in some countries,”
said the young orator, looking scornfully
down on him, “you would now be dangling
at the end of a rope thrown over the
limb of that big maple yonder, and willing
hands would be pulling you into eternity.”</p>

<p>“And if this were in some communities,”
retorted Bannister, “you would be tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and convicted and legally hanged for inciting
an ignorant and brutal populace to
riot and murder.”</p>

<p>A tall, dignified, white-haired old gentleman,
who had been scribbling on a pad,
now advanced to the edge of the platform,
holding a sheet of paper in one hand, and
resting the other easily in the bosom of his
partly buttoned frock-coat.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman,” he said impressively,
“I rise to offer the following resolution,
which I hope will be adopted without a dissenting
voice.</p>

<p>“<em>Whereas</em>, Rhett Bannister, a resident
of Mount Hermon township, and an avowed
enemy of Abraham Lincoln and the government
at Washington, has publicly affronted
the patriotism and decency of this community
this day;</p>

<p>“<em>Therefore</em>, be it resolved that we, the
citizens of Mount Hermon, hereby express
our indignation and horror at his conduct,
and declare that he has forfeited all right
to his citizenship among us, and to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
consideration on our part, and that henceforth
he shall be and is hereby utterly ostracized,
repudiated, and detested by the
citizens of Mount Hermon, and that we
use all legal measures to drive him in disgrace
from our community.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, I move the adoption
of that resolution.”</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” said the chairman,
“you have heard Judge Morgan’s
resolution, and the motion for its adoption.
Is the motion seconded?”</p>

<p>A hundred persons vied with one another
for the honor of being first to second it, and
a great, tumultuous chorus of “Aye!” indicated
its passage by an overwhelming and
unanimous vote.</p>

<p>“And now,” inquired the chairman,
“what shall be done with the prisoner?”</p>

<p>“Drive him home with his hands tied,
and let the band play him out of town to
the Rogues’ March!” cried one.</p>

<p>Whereupon the crowd shouted its enthusiastic
approval of the suggestion. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in another moment, helpless as he was,
Bannister was pulled from his chair and
from the platform, and a dozen willing
hands turned his face toward home.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a woman stood beside
him, and the resolute voice of Sarah Jane
Stark was heard:—</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, don’t you think you’re
going a little bit too far?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>A LOVER OF LINCOLN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There was an awkward pause. The
band, already on its way toward the
prisoner, halted. The man who had been
pushing Bannister along, loosened his hold.
No one seemed quite ready to answer Miss
Stark’s question. At last, the chairman of
the meeting, feeling that the duty of acting
as spokesman devolved properly upon him,
replied:—</p>

<p>“The man is a traitor, Miss Stark. He
is not fit to remain with us. It is for our
own protection that we are sending him
away.”</p>

<p>Sarah Jane Stark tossed her head scornfully.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “I don’t see that any
of you are in very great or immediate personal
danger. And as for bravery, it don’t
take much courage for fifty men to set on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
one man and tie his hands behind his back
and buffet and abuse him. I’ve watched
the whole thing, and I don’t like it. The
man made a fool of himself, that’s true, and
Judge Morgan told him so. Now you’re
making fools of yourselves, and it’s time
some one told you so. I thought I’d be the
one, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“But, Miss Stark,” persisted the chairman,
“he’s a copperhead, he’s a defamer
of the President and the country, he deserves
no consideration, either from us or
from you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added one in the crowd, “and
he’s a member of the Knights of the Golden
Circle, and they plot treason and murder.”</p>

<p>Then Bannister found his voice for the
first time in many minutes.</p>

<p>“That’s a lie,” he said. “I’m not a member
of the Knights of the Golden Circle. I
plot nothing. What I think, I say. What
I do, I’m not ashamed of. What you
cowards can do to me, I’m not afraid of.”</p>

<p>Sarah Jane Stark turned on him savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“You shut up!” she commanded. “I’m
doing the talking for this delegation.”</p>

<p>Then again she addressed the chairman
of the meeting.</p>

<p>“You ought to know,” she said, “that
I’m no copperhead. I detest ’em. You
ought to know that with two brothers and
a nephew in the Union armies I have some
sympathy with the soldiers. And if I ever
loved a man in my life I love Abe Lincoln.
But there’s nothing I love quite so much
as I do fair play. And <a href="#image03">this isn’t fair play</a>.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
<a id="image03">
  <img src="images/image03.jpg" width="453" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_54">“THIS ISN’T FAIR PLAY.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>It was strange how quiet the crowd had
become. But then, when Sarah Jane Stark
had anything to say, people were always
ready to listen.</p>

<p>“Now, the best thing for you people to
do,” she added, “the decent thing to do, is
to loosen this man’s hands, give him his
coat and hat, and let him go quietly away
to reflect on his monumental foolishness.”</p>

<p>She was already untying the handkerchief
that bound Bannister’s wrists together
as she spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Folly like his,” she went on, “brings its
own reward. Maybe the good Lord wants
him for a Union soldier and will supervise
the draft to that end. So it isn’t for you to
fly in the face of Providence and spoil it all
before the time is ripe. And you,” giving
Bannister a little push as she spoke, “you
go home and get down on your knees and
pray for common sense.”</p>

<p>No one else on earth, save possibly his
own cherished wife, could have sealed Rhett
Bannister’s lips and started him homeward
this day. But he had respect for Sarah Jane
Stark. Along with his townsmen, he honored
her motives, deferred to her judgment,
and obeyed her commands. So, almost unconsciously,
before he fairly knew what he
was doing, before he had time to think
whether he was retreating ignominiously
from his enemies, or leaving them in disgust,
he found himself alone on the highway
walking toward his home.</p>

<p>When he reached his house, he found his
wife and children all waiting for him on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
porch. Much as Bob liked music and
crowds and excitement, he had not cared
to go up to the village to-day, and had induced
Louise to stay at home with him.
And as for poor Mrs. Bannister, she shrank
with dread from meeting any of her neighbors.</p>

<p>The fact that something had happened
to him during his two hours’ absence Bannister
could not conceal. It was too evident,
from his appearance, that he had been
roughly treated. But neither of his children
dared to ask him questions, and his wife
contented herself with smoothing back his
hair and rearranging his tie, knowing full
well in her fluttering and fearful heart,
that vengeance had been meted out to him,
and that sooner or later she would know
the whole unhappy story.</p>

<p>After supper Bob set off some modest fireworks
that he had purchased a few days
before—two or three rockets, a dozen
Roman candles, some pin wheels and giant
crackers. And so, as darkness descended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the Bannister family found some little consolation,
some little relief from the nervous
strain of the last few days, in the temporary
pleasure of illuminated patriotism.</p>

<p>Yet, through it all, there was anxiety and
apprehension. Wrought up by music and
oratory and fireworks and news of victories,
there was no telling what excesses the ultra-patriotic,
irrepressible young people of the
village might indulge in at the expense of
a hated copperhead. Every noise from the
direction of the town, every sound of hoofbeats
on the highway, of footfalls on the side
path, sent a thrill to the nerves and a chill
to the heart of Mary Bannister. But, as the
evening wore on without incident, she began
to feel a measure of relief. Then the
gate-latch clicked and some one entered
the yard and started up the path toward
the house. But the suspense of uncertainty
lasted only for a moment, for the heavy
strokes of the cane on the walk, and the
uncertain footsteps, announced the approach
of their next neighbor to the east,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Seth Mills. He was cordially greeted and
invited to a seat on the porch.</p>

<p>“I’ve just heard,” he explained, “what
happened up-town to-day, an’ I thought
I’d come over an’ tell ye—”</p>

<p>“Mary,” said Bannister, “don’t you
think you had better take Louise up to
bed? It’s getting quite late. You may stay,
Robert, if you wish.”</p>

<p>And when the woman and child had said
good-night and had gone, he turned to his
visitor and continued: “Pardon me for interrupting
you, Seth; but you see they don’t
know, and I thought it was hardly worth
while to have their feelings worked up
over it.”</p>

<p>“Jest so! Jest so!” responded the old
man. “Protect the women and children.
That’s what I say. But they wasn’t much
I wanted to tell ye, Rhett, only that, accordin’
to my views, they didn’t treat ye
right, an’ I’m sorry for it. They ort to be
ashamed of it themselves. Mebbe they will
be when they’ve hed time to think it over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Me an’ you don’t agree in politics, Rhett,
nor about the war, but that ain’t no reason
why we shouldn’t treat each other decent.
That’s what I say.”</p>

<p>“And you are right about it, Seth. But
I believe that you and I are the only two
men in this community who could discuss
their political differences without passion.
You are of Kentucky ancestry, I am of South
Carolinian. These other people here are
either of the domineering Yankee type,
or else are descended from the stubborn
Pennsylvania settlers. Perhaps that accounts
for their lack of fairness and reason.
I have often wondered how Abraham
Lincoln, with his Virginia ancestry, his
Kentucky birth, and his western training,
could be so narrow, so illogical, so illiberal,
so utterly heartless as he has shown himself
to be.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think them are proper words,
Rhett, to apply to Abraham Lincoln. I
knowed him personally, you know, back in
Illinois. I’ve told you that a hundred times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
An’ I’ve studied him a good deal sence
then, and I’ve come to the conclusion ’at
they ain’t no man ever lived in this country
who can see furder ahead, an’ know better
how to git there’n Abe Lincoln. An’ I
don’t believe no other president, or king,
or emperor for that matter, has ever felt
on his heart a personal responsibility for
his country as Abe Lincoln has felt it, or
has strove or struggled or strained or labored
or prayed as Abe Lincoln hes, that
his country might be saved an’ become
great an’ happy. That’s what I say.”</p>

<p>“But, Seth, that’s mere sentiment. Take
the facts. Why can’t he see, if he has such
marvelous insight, that the South is demanding
merely her rights? All she wants
now is to be let alone, to take her property
and go, to govern herself as she sees fit.
And when she is assured that she may do
so, this war will cease, peace will come, the
horrible struggle will be at an end. Why
does Abraham Lincoln persist in striving
to compel this brave people, by force of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
arms, to pass again under the galling yoke
of his hostile government?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye why, Rhett. It’s becuz Abe
Lincoln sees better’n they do what’s best
fur ’em. He sees that ef the South was permitted
to go an’ set up a separate govamint,
an’ hev her own institutions an’ flag, an’
foreign ministers, an’ all that, ’at the next
thing, by cracky! the Western states ’d
want to jine up an’ do the same thing, with
jest as good reason, an’ then the New England
states ’d foller suit, an’ in less’n ten
years they’d be a dozen different govamints,
in place of the old United States, an’
they’d be everlastingly at each other’s
throats, an’ they wouldn’t one of ’em
amount to a hill o’ beans. It’d be rank
folly; that’s what I say.”</p>

<p>“I know, but, Seth, it’s not necessary to
borrow trouble for the future. If this man
would only do what is right and just in the
present, the future would take care of itself.
It always does. He claims that he wants to
save the Union. Very well. There’s a way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
open for him. The South is not anxious to
leave the Union. If she were assured of
the rights and consideration to which she
is entitled, she would stay with us. Abraham
Lincoln, by virtue of the power of his
office, could secure those rights to her if he
would. She must have such voice in the
control of this government as she is entitled
to have by reason of her ancestry, her
intelligence, and her patriotism. And she
must have protection for her property at
home and abroad, whether that property
consists of land, money, or slaves. Give her
these things and she would be back with us
at once. Oh, if Abraham Lincoln could
only see this and act accordingly! If he
would only cut loose from the radicals and
the abolitionists, and the petty politicians
who control him, and who even now treat
him behind his back with ridicule and contempt;
if he would only heed the counsels
of such men as Vallandigham, Fernando
Wood, Judge Woodward, and Judge Taney,
patriots all of them; if he would even now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
sue for an honorable peace and strive for
a united country, he would get it and get
it abundantly. But, alas! your Lincoln,
with his assumed simplicity, his high-sounding
phrases, and his crafty logic, is,
after all, but a coward and a time-server,
bending the country to his own selfish ends,
plunging her into destruction in order that
the bloody zealots at Washington may be
satisfied. Oh, the folly, the misery, the
tragedy of it all!”</p>

<p>The old man did not answer at once. He
sat, for a full minute, looking off to the
faint line that marked the western hill-range
from the star-flecked sky. Over in
the corner of the porch the boy, who had
listened intently, breathlessly, to the discussion,
moved and drew nearer. From
somewhere in the house came the faint
music of a good-night song. Then Seth
Mills, straightening up in his chair, took
up again the thread of conversation.</p>

<p>“I don’t see as it’s any use fur you an’
me to argy this thing, Rhett. We don’t git<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
no nearer together. We’ve each got our
opinions, an’ so fur as I can see, we’re
likely to keep ’em. But you’ve called Abe
Lincoln a coward. Now, I want to tell you
somethin’. I knowed Lincoln out there in
New Salem when he was runnin’ Denton
Offut’s store. I’ve told ye that before. An’
I’ve told ye how the Clary’s Grove boys
come down one day to match Jack Armstrong
ag’inst Lincoln in a wrastlin’ match.
An’ how, when Jack tried a foul, Abe got
mad, an’ ketched him by the throat an’
give him the blamedest shakin’ up he ever
hed in his life. I didn’t see that, but I
know the story’s straight. An’ I’ve told ye
how he straddled a log with a rope tied to
it, an’ pushed out into the Sangamon
River at flood, that spring after the deep
snow, an’ went tearin’ down with the
current, an’ saved the lives o’ three men
a-clingin’ to a tree-top in midstream, an’
come near a-losin’ of his own life a-doin’
of it. I seen him do that myself. An’ one
night, when we was settin’ round the stove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in Offut’s store, swoppin’ yarns, Jim Hanniwell
come in considable the worse fur
liquor, an’ begun a-cussin’ an’ a-swearin’
like he us’ally did when he was drunk. An’
some women come in to buy somethin’, an’
Jim never stopped, an’ Lincoln says, ‘Jim,
that’ll do, they’s women here.’ An’ Jim
allowed he’d say what he blame pleased,
women or no women, an’ he did. An’
w’en the women was gone, Lincoln come
out aroun’ from behind the counter an’
says, ‘Jim, somebody’s got to give you a
lickin’ an’ it might as well be me as anybody.’
An’ he took him an’ chucked him
out-doors, an’ throwed him into the mud in
the road, an’ rubbed dog-fennel into his
mouth, till the feller yelled fur mercy. I
seen him do that too. Mebbe I’ve told ye
all these things before, an’ mebbe I ain’t;
but I never told you, nor no one else, what
I’m goin’ to tell ye now, an’ I wouldn’t tell
ye this ef you hadn’t ’a’ said Abe Lincoln
was heartless an’ a coward. It was in that
same winter of ’32. I was out with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Clary’s Grove boys one night, an’ the liquor
went round perty free, an’ to make a long
story short, I was layin’ in a snow-bank
alongside the road, about midnight, half
a mile from my cabin, dead drunk, an’ the
weather around zero. An’ Abe Lincoln
happened along that way an’ found me. It
ain’t a nice story, Rhett, so fur’s I’m concerned,
but I’m a-talkin’ plain to-night.
He wasn’t under no obligation to me. I
wasn’t much account them days, anyway.
But he turned me over an’ seen who I wuz
an’ what the matter wuz, an’ then he twisted
me up onto his long back, Abe Lincoln did,
an’ toted me that hull half-mile up-hill, in
zero weather, to my home an’ my wife,
God bless her, an’ he dropped me on the
bed an’ he says, ‘Let him sleep it off, Mis’
Mills; he’ll feel better in the mornin’; an’
when he wakes up tell him Abe Lincoln
asks him not to drink any more.’ An’ I
ain’t, Rhett,—I ain’t teched a drop o’
liquor sence that night. But what I want
to say is that the man that had strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
enough an’ heart enough to do that fur me
who was nothin’ to him, has got strength
enough an’ heart enough an’ grit enough
to carry this country that he loves, on his
bent shoulders, through the awfulest storm
that ever swept it, till he brings it home
safe an’ sound an’ unbroken to all of us.
It’s a mighty task, Rhett Bannister; but
he’s a-goin’ to do it; I know ’im, an’ I tell
ye he’s a-goin’ to do it; an’ when he’s done
it, you an’ me an’ ev’ry man ’at loves his
country as he ort to, is goin’ to git down on
our knees an’ thank God ’at Abraham
Lincoln ever lived.”</p>

<p>Clear and resonant on the night air the
old man’s voice rang as he finished his
story and rose to his feet. And while his
face could not be seen for the darkness,
they who heard him felt that it was aglow
with enthusiasm and love for the largest-minded,
biggest-hearted man that had
ever crossed his path—Abraham Lincoln.
And Bob, leaning far forward in his chair,
drinking in every word of the story, thrilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
with the earnestness of the speaker, felt
his heart fired anew with reverence and
enthusiasm for the great war-president, and
with zeal for the cause which he had so
faithfully espoused.</p>

<p>Rhett Bannister was too much of a gentleman
and too deeply artistic in temperament
to try to break with argument or depreciation
the force of the old man’s recital.</p>

<p>“Oh, well!” he said, rising. “We all
have our heroes. This would be a sad world
if there were no heroes to worship. And I
can’t blame you, Seth, for having put a halo
around Lincoln’s head.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Rhett; good-night!”</p>

<p>The old man limped slowly down the
path and out into the road and turned his
face toward home. After that, to those
who sat upon the porch, the quiet of the
windless, starlit summer night was unbroken.
Over in the direction of the village
an occasional rocket flared up into the
sky and fell back into darkness—nothing
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>But from that night the dominating personality
in Bob Bannister’s life was Abraham
Lincoln. Look which way he would,
the vision of that rugged, kindly face, which
he had seen so often pictured, and the tall,
gaunt form, stood out ever before his eyes,
heroic, paternal, potential to the uttermost.
From Seth Mills he obtained a small
volume published in 1860 reciting the
President’s career. And from the same
source he got what was much better, that
modest, unique sketch of Lincoln’s life,
written by himself at about the same time
for the same purpose. These books he read
and reread many times, and the oftener he
read them the greater grew his admiration
for the one great hero of his thought and
life.</p>

<p>In the meantime, under the conscription
act of March 3, 1863, put in force by the
proclamation of the President, the enrollment
for the draft went on. In many of the
states the drawings were made in July.
On the thirteenth of that month began the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
draft riots in the city of New York, which
were suppressed only after the destruction
by the mob of much property, after
the shedding of much blood and the loss
of many lives. The country was deeply
stirred. The anti-war party took advantage
of the opportunity to denounce the government
at Washington openly and bitterly.
Only in communities where the sentiment
was intensely patriotic was the policy of
the draft upheld. Mount Hermon was
one of these communities. Already partially
depopulated by her voluntary contributions
of men to the Union armies, she
nevertheless accepted the situation philosophically
and cheerfully, believing with
Lincoln, that this was the only practical way
to put a speedy end to the war.</p>

<p>But to Rhett Bannister this draft was
the crowning act of infamy perpetrated by
a tyrannical government. His whole nature
rebelled against the idea of being compelled,
on pain of death, to bear arms against
his brothers of the South whom he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to be absolutely in the right. It was not
until September, however, that the drawing
for the Congressional district in which
he resided, the Eleventh of Pennsylvania,
took place at Easton under the supervision
of the provost-marshal, Captain Samuel
Yohe.</p>

<p>It happened that on the afternoon of the
last day of the drawing Bob went up to the
village to make some purchases and do
some errands for his father. Since his unfortunate
experience on Independence Day
Rhett Bannister had not often been seen
among his neighbors. Aside from a few of
the more radical sympathizers with the
Southern cause, not many people sought
him socially, and by the entire Union element
he was practically ostracized.</p>

<p>The condemnation visited on his father
Bob could not wholly escape. While there
were few who knew of his own loyalty,
there were many who knew only that he
was the son of Rhett Bannister the despised
copperhead. So, in these days, when Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
went up to the village he spent no time in
loitering, or visiting, or playing with his
former schoolfellows. His errands done, he
started without delay on his way toward
home.</p>

<p>But, on this September afternoon, there
was excitement at the village. For two successive
days the names drawn from the
wheel at Easton had included but a bare
half-dozen from Mount Hermon. And
these were the names of men who could
well afford to pay the three hundred dollars
demanded by the government as the price
of their release from service. But to-day,
the last day of the drawing, it was more
than probable that the number of men
drafted from Mount Hermon would be at
least doubled.</p>

<p>So, as the day wore on, the crowd about
the door of the post-office increased. At
five o’clock a special messenger would
arrive from Carbon Creek with a list of the
men that day drafted from Mount Hermon
township, the list having been sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
by telegraph from Easton to that station.</p>

<p>When finally the messenger arrived,
Bob was listening with breathless interest
to a discussion concerning the Emancipation
Proclamation, and it was only when
he heard some one shout, “Here’s the
list!” that he realized what had happened.</p>

<p>“Let Adam Johns read it,” demanded
a man in the crowd.</p>

<p>Whereupon the young schoolmaster,
mounting a chair, and unfolding the paper
placed in his hands, began to read. And
the very first name that he read was his
own. He looked out calmly over the group
of men before him, his face paling somewhat
with the shock of the news.</p>

<p>“I will go,” he said. “I ought to have
gone before. I am ashamed to have waited
for—for this—but—”</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Adam!” interrupted
some one in the crowd, who knew how the
schoolmaster’s widowed mother leaned on
him for comfort and support, “you’re all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
right. There’s a dozen of us here that’ll
be sons to her when you go.”</p>

<p>The young man wiped from his eyes the
sudden moisture that dimmed his sight,
and went on with the reading of the list.
It was not a long one. There were some
surprises, but there was no demonstration.
For the most part the reading was greeted
with the silence of intense earnestness.
And the very last name on the list was the
name of Rhett Bannister. The schoolmaster’s
hand grasping the paper fell to his
side. For an instant no one spoke. Then
a man shouted, “Hurrah for the draft!”
and another one cried, “Uncle Sam’s got
him now!” and then, amid the confusion
of voices, men were heard everywhere congratulating
one another on the drafting of
Rhett Bannister.</p>

<p>With flushed face Bob started for the
door, and the crowd parted to let him pass.
But outside he ran into a group of his
schoolmates, the same boys who had court-martialed
him and dismissed him in disgrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
from their company three months
before.</p>

<p>“Old man got struck with lightnin’ this
time, didn’t he, Bob?” called out Sam
Powers.</p>

<p>“He’ll skedaddle for Pike County when
he hears about it,” added “Brilly.” “Better
run home an’ tell him, quick.”</p>

<p>“He don’t dare to,” responded Sam.
“I’ll dare you,” he continued, shaking his
forefinger in Bob’s face, “to go home an’
tell your copperhead dad he’s drafted!”</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks!” exclaimed Bill Hinkle.
“You fellows are smart, ain’t you! Let
him alone. He ain’t done nothin’ to you.
Aw, shucks!”</p>

<p>And then Bob got angry.</p>

<p>“It’s none o’ you fellows’ business,” he
said, “whether my father’s drafted or not.
You’re bullies an’ cowards, the whole lot
of you! Get out o’ my way!”</p>

<p>And so, with flashing eye, heaving breast,
erect head, he passed through the crowd of
boys untouched. Awed and silenced by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
outburst of wrath, they dared not molest
him. But, as he went down the road
through the gathering twilight toward his
home, he began to wonder if, after all, Sam
Powers was not right. Would he dare to
tell his father?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>THE DRAFTED COPPERHEAD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Would he dare to tell his father
about the draft? The question kept
repeating itself in Bob Bannister’s mind,
and the answer to it grew more and
more uncertain as he drew nearer to his
home. Already he could see the gabled
roof of the house, and, back of it, dimly
outlined against the gray sky, the white
blades of the windmill, free from their
lashing, whirling swiftly in the rising wind.
The windmill did the work of three men
for Rhett Bannister. It sawed his wood,
pumped his water, churned his milk,
threshed his grain, and drove the machinery
by which he manufactured his stock in
trade. A few years before the beginning of
the war he had secured a patent on a design
for a beehive, ingeniously adapted to the
instinct of the bees, and so arranged as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
make their product removable quickly,
easily, and at any time. His success in the
manufacture and sale of these hives had
been so great that for a time he was quite
unable to supply the demand for them.
Then the war came, and with it, and as a
consequence of it, his ever-growing unpopularity;
and, almost before he knew it, his
business had so fallen away that it became
necessary for him to dismiss his hired help,
and he himself had little to do save to manufacture
and store his product in hope of
better times. Indeed, for the last few weeks
the whir of the wheel had been an unusual
sound, and Bob wondered as he drew near,
that it should be going on this day, especially
at so late an hour. So, instead of
stopping at the house, he went straight on to
the shop entrance, to discover, if possible,
the cause of this unwonted activity.</p>

<p>At the bench, in the gloom, he saw his
father, fashioning, with the power-saw, a
heavy block of wood into the form of a
brace. The man did not look up from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
work as the boy entered; perhaps he did not
hear him come.</p>

<p>“I’m back, father,” said Bob; “I saw
the windmill going and I came on over
here.”</p>

<p>“Yes; you’re late. What kept you?”</p>

<p>“Why, nothing in particular.”</p>

<p>“Were there any letters?”</p>

<p>Then Bob remembered that in his eagerness
to hear the discussion concerning the
Emancipation Proclamation, in his excitement
over the reading of the draft-list, and
in his haste to get away after his father’s
name had been announced, he had forgotten
to inquire for his mail.</p>

<p>“Why, I—didn’t get the mail,” he
stammered. “I—I—didn’t ask for it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>The man laid down his work, slipped the
belt from the pulley, and turned toward
Bob.</p>

<p>“Because—” replied the boy, “because
I wanted to get away.”</p>

<p>“Mean again to you, were they? Small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
contemptible spirits! How tyranny in high
places is always imitated by the mob!”</p>

<p>“Not so much that, father; but—there
was news.”</p>

<p>“Oh, news. I see. Was the conscription-list
in?”</p>

<p>“A special messenger brought it.”</p>

<p>“And did you see it? or hear it read?”</p>

<p>“Adam Johns read it out loud.”</p>

<p>And then there was silence between
them. The man could not quite condescend
to ask for the desired information; the boy
could not quite bring himself to the point
of volunteering it. So they stood there in
the gathering darkness, speechless. Over
their heads the great wheel creaked and
whirred. And each knew, in his heart, that
the other knew that Rhett Bannister’s
name was on the list of drafted men.</p>

<p>Out in the road there was the noise of
wagon-wheels going by, mingled with the
talking of men. And then, above the rattle
of the wheels, above the creaking and
groaning of the windmill, above the howling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of the wind, came the voice of one
shouting:—</p>

<p>“Rhett Bannister—you copperhead—you’re
drafted—thank God!”</p>

<p>That was all. The voices were again
silent. The wagon passed on, the whir and
wheeze of the windmill never ceased. In
the darkness Bob could not see his father’s
face, but he knew as well how it looked as
though the sun of midday shone on it. And
then, involuntarily, from his own lips came
the confirmation:—</p>

<p>“Father, it is true.”</p>

<p>But Rhett Bannister did not reply. He
stood there in the darkness, dimly outlined,
immovable. Still the wheel went round,
faster and faster in the driving wind, and
the boughs of the maples, bending and
springing in the gale, swept and scraped
against the eaves of the work-shop. Then
the doorway was darkened by another figure.
Bob’s mother, peering into the gloom,
called out:—</p>

<p>“Rhett, dear, are you there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Mary.”</p>

<p>“Rob hasn’t come yet.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, I’m here too.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad! What was it those men
shouted, Rhett? Does it mean any harm
to you?”</p>

<p>“I hope not, Mary. It was just some
wild zealot echoing the sentiment of his
crazy masters, that’s all. We’ll go in to
supper now.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Bannister pulled the lever
that clamped the wheel, and the whirring
and grinding ceased. Then he locked the
shop-door and they all went down the path
to the house.</p>

<p>At the supper-table the subject of the
draft was not mentioned. But, later in the
evening, after Bob’s sister had gone to bed,
and a wood-fire had been lighted in the
fireplace, for it had grown suddenly cold,
Rhett Bannister chose to inform his wife of
the situation. Try as he might to prevent
it, the social blight which had fallen on him
covered her also with its sinister darkness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Her heart was deeply troubled. She passed
her days in anxiety and her nights in fear.
She knew little of the deep undercurrents
of political passion and of fratricidal strife
that were undermining the bed-rock of the
nation. She knew only that she trusted her
husband and believed in him, and was
ready to endure any suffering for his sake.
And while, always, he sought to protect and
comfort her, even to the extent of keeping
from her knowledge such matters as would
give her unnecessary anxiety or alarm, still
there were times when he thought she ought,
for the sake of all of them, to know what
was happening. And to-night was one of
those times.</p>

<p>“Sit here, Mary,” he said. “Let’s talk
over this matter of the draft. That rowdy
shouted, and Robert confirms the report,
that I have been drafted. That means
that I shall have to go and fight in the
ranks of the Union armies, whether I will
or no.”</p>

<p>“O Rhett! Do you mean that you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to go as Charley Hitchner did, and John
Strongmeyer?”</p>

<p>“Yes, only they were drafted by the
state. The government at Washington
chooses to take me.”</p>

<p>“But what shall I do without you? If
they knew how impossible it is for you to go
and leave me alone, they wouldn’t make
you do it, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear. The privations and sufferings
of wives and children are not considered.
The administration at Washington
needs men to carry on this unholy war, and
wives may starve and babies may die, but
the war must go on. There, Mary, never
mind,” as the tears came into the woman’s
eyes, “I haven’t gone yet. Perhaps I’ll
not go. A man’s house is his castle, you
know. They’ll have hard work to take
me if I choose to stay. Well, Rob, who
else was drafted? You heard the list
read.”</p>

<p>“Yes, father, Adam Johns read it. His
own name was the first one on it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! poor old Mrs. Johns. She idolizes
that boy.”</p>

<p>“And must Adam Johns go to war?”
inquired Mrs. Bannister, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” replied Bob. “He said
he would go. He said he was sorry he had
waited for the draft. And Henry Bradbury
said he would take care of Adam’s mother.
And a lot more said so too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well!” rejoined Bannister, “such
obligations rest lightly on the consciences
of those who make them after the excitement
and passion have died out. Poor
Anna Johns will have to look out for herself
if her boy goes. And if he dies, God help
her! Who else were drawn, Robert?”</p>

<p>“Why, Elias Traviss. They said he
would pay his three hundred dollars exemption
money, though, and stay home; that he
could well afford to do it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bannister, bitterly, “there
lies the iniquity of the whole proceeding.
The rich man may buy his release from
service with money; the poor man must pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the price with his body, his blood, his life,
perhaps. It’s barbarous; it’s inhuman!”</p>

<p>Then, all in a moment, Mary Bannister
grasped the idea of purchased exemption.</p>

<p>“Why, Rhett!” she exclaimed, “you
have that money in the bank, you know.
If they come for you, you can pay them the
three hundred dollars and stay at home, the
same as Elias Traviss is going to do. Can’t
he, Robbie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, or hire a substitute the
same as ’Squire Matthews did.”</p>

<p>“So you won’t have to go, Rhett, you see,
even if you are drafted. And we can well
afford the money.”</p>

<p>Bannister looked from his wife to his son,
and back again, with a smile of pity on his
lips for their simplicity. But there was no
anger in his voice as he replied:—</p>

<p>“That is true, Mary. Doubtless I could
purchase immunity from the draft with
money. But my money would be used by
me to buy a substitute, or by the government
for the purposes of the war, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
moral guilt on my part would be even
greater than though I went myself. No, I
shall not purchase my release, nor shall I go
to war. There are means of defending my
rights and my person against this tyranny,
and I shall exercise them. I may die in the
attempt, but I shall not have it charged
against my memory that I fought my brothers
of the South with bayonet and rifle, or
helped others to do it.”</p>

<p>In his excitement, he rose from his chair
and paced up and down the floor, but, in a
moment, growing calmer, he added:—</p>

<p>“Oh, well! they haven’t come for me
yet. Let’s not borrow trouble. We’ll have
it soon enough. Keep a stout heart, Mary.
And we’ll all go to bed now and sleep away
our cares.”</p>

<p>It was all very well for Rhett Bannister
to speak thus lightly of sleeping away cares,
but as for his poor wife, she lay half the
night, dreading lest the next noise she
should hear might be Lincoln’s soldiers
come to take away her husband to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
both he and she considered a cruel, causeless
war. Nor did sleep come quickly to
close Bob’s eyes. Never before had the
conflict between parental love and duty and
his exalted sense of patriotism been so fierce
and strong. Yet, reason with himself as he
would, he was not able to convince either
his heart or his judgment that his father
was right and that Abraham Lincoln was
wrong. And as the great War President
expounded his thought on the crisis to the
American people, and governed his conduct
accordingly, Bob Bannister believed in him,
trusted him, followed him in spirit, and
would have followed him in body had he
been of sufficient age to bear arms.</p>

<p>But here and now was the fact of his
father’s conscription to deal with; a fact
which opened the door to untold trouble,
to possible, if not probable, tragedy. For
Bob knew that in declaring his proposed
resistance to the draft his father was not
indulging in mere bravado. What Rhett
Bannister said he meant, and what he undertook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to do he did if it was within the
power of human accomplishment. So Bob
waited in dread for the coming of the
officer to serve the notice of the draft.</p>

<p>But when, three days after the drawing, a
deputy provost-marshal did come with a
conscription notice, neither Bob nor his
father was at home. So the notice was left
at the house with Mrs. Bannister, and she,
poor woman, after contemplating it all the
afternoon with dread and apprehension,
thrust it into her husband’s hand at night,
saying deprecatingly, tearfully:—</p>

<p>“O Rhett, I couldn’t help it! He just
gave it to me, and I didn’t know what it
meant till I read it, and I don’t know now,
except I suppose it means that you are
really drafted and must go to war. And he
wouldn’t stay to let me tell him why it was
just impossible for you to go, and—and
that’s all I know about it, Rhett dear.”</p>

<p>Bannister took the notice and read it
over. It was simply to the effect that, in
accordance with the Act of Congress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
March 3, 1863, he had been drawn to serve
for three years, or during the war, as a
soldier in the armies of the United States.
It further notified him to report for duty
within ten days from the date of service of
the notice, at the office of the provost-marshal
for the district, Captain Samuel Yohe,
at Easton, Pa. There was an additional
notice to those desiring to purchase release
from service, to pay the three hundred dollars
commutation money to the deputy internal-revenue
collector for the district.</p>

<p>When he had carefully read the notice
a second time, Bannister folded it and laid
it on the desk.</p>

<p>“I have ten days of peace,” he said, “in
which to prepare for war.”</p>

<p>Thereafter he was very busy. He cleaned
up many odds and ends of work as though
he were preparing for a long journey.
Oddly enough, however, he spent much
time in making repairs to his windmill.
He carried the boxing of the shaft higher
above the roof of his shop, closed the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
it over carefully, and made a little window
in each of the four sides. He appeared
anxious to get it completed before a storm
should come up. Little was said about the
draft, or about his personal liability for
service, and the subject of commutation
money, or a substitute, was not again so
much as mentioned. But it was with a sense
of dread and apprehension that Mrs. Bannister
and Bob saw the days go by, saw the
preparations going forward for the approaching
crisis, noted the fixed lips and the
unfaltering eye that always indicated that
Rhett Bannister’s mind was made up and
that wild horses could not drag him from
his purpose. Once, the thought flashed
across Bob’s mind that possibly, instead of
attempting to resist the draft, his father had
decided to accept the inevitable and report
for duty as a soldier of the United States.
And the idea sent such a thrill of joy
through him, so set the blood to bounding
in his veins, opened up to him such a vision
of pride and exultation, that it was hard for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
him to get back to the level of the stubborn
fact that all the work being done by his
father was being done simply for the purpose
of being better prepared to resist the
officers of the law.</p>

<p>So, on the evening of the tenth day from
the date of service of notice of the draft,
Rhett Bannister was still at his home. With
apparent unconcern he sat at the table in
his sitting-room reading a late copy of the
New York <cite>Day-Book</cite>, a violent anti-administration
journal which had that day
reached him.</p>

<p>“The <cite>Day-Book</cite> is right,” he said, laying
down the paper, “in declaring that if there
was any manhood left in Pennsylvania, her
citizens would rise in armed rebellion
against the enforcement of this cruel and
obnoxious draft as did the citizens of New
York city in July. If the army had both
ways to face, North and South, the war
would soon be at end. Well, I am but one
against the powers at Washington, but all
the armies of the United States cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
force me to wear their uniform and bear
their weapons against my will.”</p>

<p>By that speech, Bob’s hopes, if he still
cherished any, were completely dashed. He
knew by that that his father would resist
the enforcement of the draft to the end,
bitter and bloody though the end might be.</p>

<p>The ten days had expired. All the other
drafted men from Mount Hermon had
gone to Easton. But Rhett Bannister had
not responded to the call. Henceforth, by
the terms of the conscription act, he was
classed as a deserter, subject to arrest,
court-martial, and speedy execution. He
himself said that a price was now on his
head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bannister went about the house,
pale, apprehensive, starting fearfully at
every unusual sound, peering constantly
up the road, yet in dread of what she might
see there.</p>

<p>For Bob, his days were miserable and his
nights were sleepless. He turned over constantly
in his mind scheme after scheme to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
save the honor of the family and to relieve
his father from the desperate situation
in which he had placed himself. But all
schemes were useless, impractical, impossible.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after the expiration of
the time-limit, a rumor from a friendly
source floated down secretly to the Bannister
homestead, to the effect that a detachment
of United States soldiers, members
of the invalid corps, on provost-guard duty,
had reached the county seat and were
about to start out to round up deserters,
and drafted men who had failed to respond.
They were likely, the warning went, to appear
at Mount Hermon at any hour. Loyal
citizens said that Rhett Bannister had
reached the end of his rope; and radical
Unionists remarked that the end of that
rope had a loop in it.</p>

<p>Seth Mills came over that afternoon to
have a last talk with his obdurate neighbor.</p>

<p>“It won’t do any good, Rhett,” he declared.
“They’re bound to git ye sooner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
or later, dead or alive. Now what’s the use
o’ bein’ so confounded pigheaded an’ contrary?
Why don’t you jest make up your
mind to go like a man an’ hev done with it,
fer your wife’s sake, an’ your children’s
sake, an’ your country’s sake, by cracky!
That’s what I say.”</p>

<p>And Bannister replied:—</p>

<p>“I would be less than a man, Seth, if I
yielded principle and pride, and humbled
and stultified myself like a coward, in order
to make it easy for my family and myself.
No matter what the outcome of this awful
struggle may be, no matter what becomes
of me in this crisis, I intend that my children
and my children’s children shall say
of me, in the days to come: ‘He kept his
judgment and his conscience clear.’ I will
not yield, Seth, I will not yield.”</p>

<p>And that ended the argument, and Seth
Mills limped back home, discouraged, saddened,
angry, that his neighbor, whom he
loved for his many kindnesses and sterling
character, should be so blind to his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
interests, so obstinate, so childish, so utterly
unreasonable.</p>

<p>That night, some time after midnight,
Bob was wakened from a troubled sleep,
more by the feeling that something was
going wrong than by any actual noises that
he heard. He sat up in bed and listened,
and, from somewhere outside the house, the
sound of low voices came distinctly to his
ears. He leaped to the floor, thinking that
at last the provost-guard had come to apprehend
his father, and had chosen the
night-time for their errand, thinking the
more easily to find him. Hastily slipping
on his shoes and trousers, he started down
the hall. By a ray of moonlight which fell
through the hall-window he discovered his
mother standing at the door of her room,
fully dressed.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rob,” she whispered, “be still!
be still!”</p>

<p>When he came closer to her he saw that
she had been weeping and that her face was
white with fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’s father?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Hush! He’s not here. He went out
after you went to bed. He’s been away
all night. Oh, Robbie, look here!”</p>

<p>She took his hand and led him to the window
of her room and pointed out into the
road. Distinctly, in the moonlight, he saw
a man in uniform, carrying a gun, pacing
back and forth along the road in front
of the house. Then she took him to the
hall-window, and showed him another soldier
leaning carelessly against the garden
fence, with his eyes fixed on the rear of the
house.</p>

<p>“There are four of them,” she said.
“They came a few minutes ago. I saw
them come down the road. They have
surrounded the house.”</p>

<p>“But, father,” repeated Bob; “where’s
father?”</p>

<p>“Hush, Robbie, hush! They won’t find
him. They think he’s here in the house,
but he isn’t. He left it long before they
came.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, where is he, mother? I insist on
knowing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so loud, Robbie. You’ll
waken Louise. They’ll hear you.”</p>

<p>“Did he go to the woods, mother? to
the barn? to the shop? where?”</p>

<p>“Hush! my boy, hush! Don’t whisper it.
He went to the shop. He’s in—Robbie,
listen, he’s in the windmill tower. He has
his gun with him, and his revolver. He’s
going to—to—”</p>

<p>She reeled and fell, fainting and exhausted,
into the boy’s arms, and he led and
dragged her back into her own room, and
laid her tenderly on her bed. He chafed her
hands and bathed her face, and by and by
she returned to consciousness, and told
him in more detail of the manner in which
his father had left the house, and of the
coming of the soldiers. But she never
loosened her clasp of his hand until the
gray light in the eastern sky announced the
approach of dawn.</p>

<p>Then there came a knocking at the hall-door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of the house. Bob released his hand
from his mother’s, and slipped quietly into
his own room and began to put on the rest
of his clothes. But, long before he had
finished, the knocking was repeated. It
came louder, more persistently. He made
haste to be ready, but, before he could
leave his room, the knocking was again renewed,
with strokes that resounded through
the house. Somehow it reminded him of
the knocking at the gate in <i>Macbeth</i>, and
of the awful tragedy which the opening of
that gate was to disclose. What tragedy
would follow the knocking at the door of
the house of Bannister?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>AN UNEXPECTED BREAKFAST</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">As Bob descended the stairs to open the
hall-door in response to the knocking,
his mother stood on the upper landing,
trembling with excitement and fear. When
the door was finally opened, she could see,
dimly outlined in the doorway, a man
dressed in the uniform of a sergeant in the
army of the United States.</p>

<p>“We have come,” he said to Bob, “by
order of the provost-marshal, to arrest Rhett
Bannister, who has been drafted and has
failed to respond.”</p>

<p>The man was courteous in manner, but
firm of speech.</p>

<p>“He is not here,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said the man, “but we
believe he is here. He was in this house
last night. To the best of our knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
he has not left it. We shall be obliged to
search the premises.”</p>

<p>“You may do so,” answered Bob, “but
I assure you he is not here.”</p>

<p>Without waiting to discuss the matter,
the sergeant stepped into the hall, followed
by a private in uniform. Outside, the house-doors
were guarded by the two soldiers who
remained.</p>

<p>If Rhett Bannister were within, there
would be no chance for him to escape. The
sergeant pushed his way into the parlor and
sitting-room, threw open the blinds, and
looked carefully about him. He went into
the dining-room, raised the shades, and
examined the pantries and the kitchen.
He procured a lantern, went into the cellar
and searched every nook and corner of it.</p>

<p>“It is necessary for me,” he said when
he came back up the cellar-stairs, “to ask
permission to go into the second story. Who
is up there?”</p>

<p>“My mother and my young sister,” replied
Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you kindly go ahead and tell them
that we are coming. I shall have to examine
every room.”</p>

<p>“You may go now,” said the boy. “My
mother is dressed.”</p>

<p>So they went, all three, upstairs. The
soldiers peered into the room where Louise,
undisturbed by the noise, still slept peacefully
on. In the presence of Mrs. Bannister
the sergeant removed his cap.</p>

<p>“I regret this necessity, madam,” he
said, “but we are under orders to arrest
Rhett Bannister, and it is our duty to make
this search.”</p>

<p>The woman was too much frightened to
reply, so the party went on into the other
rooms, up the ladder into the attic, into all
the corners and closets, everywhere. When
the search was completed, the sergeant came
back to the head of the stairs and addressed
Mrs. Bannister.</p>

<p>“You are Rhett Bannister’s wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” tremblingly, “yes, I am his wife.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, but your husband is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
classed as a deserter. If he is arrested he
becomes subject to the death penalty. I
believe that only a prompt surrender on
his part will lead to a suspension or abatement
of his sentence. If you know where
he is I would advise you, for your own
sake, to urge him to give himself up at
once.”</p>

<p>She turned to Bob, appealingly.</p>

<p>“Do I have to tell, Robbie? Do I? Do
I have to? Would it be better?”</p>

<p>“No, mother, you don’t have to, and it
wouldn’t be better. Father has made up
his mind what he wants to do, and we have
no right to interfere with his plans.”</p>

<p>The frightened woman was clinging to
Bob’s arm and looking up tearfully into
his face.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to be obliged to add,” said
the sergeant, “that all persons who aid and
abet a deserter in his efforts to escape arrest,
are classed as co-conspirators with him,
and as traitors to their country, and are subject
to punishment accordingly. So, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
either of you have any knowledge as to
Rhett Bannister’s whereabouts, I—”</p>

<p>But at this point the terrified woman
gave way completely; the sympathizing
sergeant turned away from her, and Bob
led her, sobbing convulsively, back to her
own room. When he was again able to leave
her and go downstairs, he found that the
soldiers had made a thorough search of the
out-of-door premises, and were just returning
from the shop, the lock on the door
of which they had forced, and the interior
of which they had explored. Strangely
enough, it had not occurred to them to examine
the tower of the windmill. There
was nothing about it, either in the shop or
on the outside, which would indicate to the
casual observer that it might become a
hiding-place for a fugitive. If it had occurred
to them, and they had proceeded
with such a search, the tragedy which Bob
feared would surely have come. For Rhett
Bannister, standing in his cramped quarters
within the tower, watching, through his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
port-hole, the movements of the soldiers
about his house and yard, and their approach
to the shop, listening to the breaking
of the lock on the shop-door, and to
the exploration going on beneath him, was
ready, on the instant of discovery, from his
point of advantage, to shoot to kill any
person who attempted to force him from
his place of concealment. Yet, for that
morning at least, a merciful Providence so
blinded the eyes and dulled the wits of those
soldiers as to save Rhett Bannister from
the disgrace and horror of shedding another’s
blood.</p>

<p>When Bob came out on the kitchen
porch and glanced involuntarily and fearfully
up at the windmill tower, he caught a
glimpse of a rifle-barrel through one of the
small dark openings his father had made,
and knew, on the instant, how narrowly
the household had escaped a tragedy. For,
even as he looked, the soldiers were coming
back, by the garden-path, to the house.
The young sergeant was plainly disappointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and vexed over the result of his
expedition. He had hoped and intended to
have credit for bagging the most notorious
copperhead in that section of the state. And
now that his ambition was likely to fail of
realization, he could not quite repress his
deep feeling of annoyance. He came back
to the boy on the porch.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be harsh,” he said,
“but from either you or your mother I
must have definite information as to Rhett
Bannister’s whereabouts. I believe both of
you know where he is.”</p>

<p>“My mother is already so frightened by
your raid,” replied Bob, “that if she knew
and was willing to tell, I doubt whether she
would be able to. But you may ask me any
questions you like.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Do you know where your
father is at this moment?”</p>

<p>“I believe I do.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“I will not tell.”</p>

<p>The sergeant’s face flushed, and he bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
his drooping moustache. He was plainly
angry.</p>

<p>“I have already told you,” he said, “that
to shield deserters is an offense hardly less
treasonable than desertion itself. I don’t
intend to be balked in this thing. Your
father is somewhere about these premises.
I know, for I have had the house watched.
He could not have escaped. You can point
out his hiding-place to me, or I will put you
under arrest and take you before the provost-marshal.”</p>

<p>The boy’s face paled and his lip quivered,
but he was still resolute.</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” he said, “but I’ll not tell.”</p>

<p>“Very well, come on!”</p>

<p>The sergeant spoke gruffly, and laid a
rough hand on the lad’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Let me go first and tell my mother.”</p>

<p>“No. It’s your choice to go—go now.
March!”</p>

<p>Then a better thought came into the sergeant’s
mind. Down on the Delaware a
good and anxious mother was fearing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
praying for him. The thought of her softened
his anger.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “go and tell her. Tell
her anything you like. But sooner or later
you will tell us what we want to know.”</p>

<p>Bob hurried upstairs to his mother’s
room.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said, “<a href="#image04">I’ve discovered a
way to get rid of these men.</a> I’ve offered
to go up to Mount Hermon with them.
When we are gone you can let father
know.”</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_108">“I’VE DISCOVERED A WAY TO GET RID OF THESE MEN.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, Robbie! they don’t mean any harm
to you?”</p>

<p>“None at all, mother. But tell father—tell
father not to go into the windmill
tower again. They might find out—somehow—that
that’s his hiding-place, and
come back here before I do, to get him.
Tell him not to go into the tower again,
<em>not for anything</em>.”</p>

<p>He kissed his mother good-by and hurried
out into the hall. His little sister stood
there, clad in her nightdress, with flushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
cheeks and rumpled hair and wondering
eyes.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Dotty!” he called back to
her as he hurried down the stairs. “I’ve
got to go up to town early this morning.
I’m off now. You jump back into bed and
get your beauty sleep.”</p>

<p>In another minute he was out in the road
with the sergeant and his three men, and
they went marching away toward Mount
Hermon. The young officer was inclined
to be silent and severe at first, but he soon
thawed out, and then Bob found his conversation
to be most interesting. He said,
in answer to the boy’s inquiry, that he
had been in the service since almost the
beginning of the war. He had been with
McClellan all through the Peninsular Campaign.
He had fought at Antietam and at
Fredericksburg and Gettysburg. In that
last great battle a bullet had pierced his
thigh, severing a small artery, and he
had nearly bled to death before receiving
surgical attention. But he was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
well now, and ready again for active service.</p>

<p>And as they walked on, and the young
man told of his battles and his marches and
his wounds, of the glory of fighting for the
old flag, and of his ardent hope for ultimate
victory and peace, and above all, of his
reverence for the great and noble President
at Washington, whom all the soldiers
loved and honored, and for whom they
would cheerfully have died, Bob felt the
tides of patriotism rising high and higher
in his breast; and, notwithstanding the
errand which the young soldier had tried
his best to perform, the boy could not help
feeling in his heart that here indeed was
a hero worthy of his admiration.</p>

<p>Absorbed in the story, carried away by
his enthusiasm for a cause which could
command such fealty as this, he forgot, for
the time, that his father, a despised copperhead,
a fugitive from the execution of the
draft, with the penalty for desertion hanging
over his head, was still back at the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
home, ready to shed the blood of any who
might dare seek to apprehend him. He forgot
that he himself was under arrest as a
traitor, charged with aiding and abetting his
father, on his way to the office of the provost-marshal,
where he must either purge
himself from contempt, by answering the
questions put to him, or suffer the penalty
of his disobedience. So, with glowing eyes
and flushed cheeks and swiftly beating
heart, he told of his own hopes and beliefs
and desires, of his own longing for the
ascendency of the Union cause, of his faith
in the great generals, Meade, Sheridan,
Sherman, Grant, and of his absolute devotion
to the one overmastering hero of the
mighty war, Abraham Lincoln. And when
he had told all these things, with an earnestness
and enthusiasm that stamped
them as unmistakably genuine, and his own
patriotism as quite unsullied, it is small
wonder that the heart of the young soldier
warmed to him, and, before either of them
was aware of it, they were the best of friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>At a turn in the road the perspective of
the long straight street that led through the
village lay before them. The leafage of
October, red and yellow and glorious along
the maple-bordered highway, grew brilliant
in the morning light. Back in the valley
below them, as they turned and looked, they
saw the fog-banks, which had lain heavy and
close to the earth, beginning to break and
drift away under the influence of the morning
sun. The young sergeant bared his
head and gazed in admiration at the rolling
landscape, as it broadened away to the
east.</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” he exclaimed. “Beautiful!
I remember a morning down in the Shenandoah
Valley when the sun rose on a
landscape much like this; and, even in the
stress of the work on hand, I admired it
and remember it.”</p>

<p>“What was the work, sergeant?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Covering the retreat of a beaten army,
my boy; one of the gloomiest tasks of war:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
on every side the evidence of disaster and
the wrecks of battle: abandoned cannon,
broken wheels, carcasses of horses, the suffering
wounded, and the unburied dead.
Oh! war is a terrible thing after all—a
terrible thing. To-morrow I go back to it.
I report for duty to my regiment somewhere
down on the Rappahannock.”</p>

<p>Bob spoke up eagerly:—</p>

<p>“Then you won’t be able to go back
to—to—”</p>

<p>“To get Rhett Bannister? No. That
duty will devolve on some one else now. I
must report to the provost-marshal at
Easton to-night. It’s too bad I couldn’t
have had the credit of capturing him, he’s
such a notorious copperhead. Oh, I forgot!
You’re his son, aren’t you? And I have
you under arrest, taking you to the provost-marshal.
That’s strange! Why, boy, you
are no traitor. I never saw a man more
loyal than you are. Indeed, I have talked
with few men who know more about the
war, the campaigns, and the generals. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
never heard a man outside the ranks express
more genuine devotion to his country.
How is it? What do you mean by having
Rhett Bannister for a father?”</p>

<p>“I can’t explain it,” replied Bob, “except
that I know he’s honest about it, and truly
believes he’s right. He’s of Southern ancestry,
you know. His father was a South
Carolinian. I can’t blame him. I don’t
blame him. I’ve tried to think the way he
does about it, and not be against him, but
I can’t, I simply can’t!”</p>

<p>“No, my boy, you can’t! But you can
tell me where he is. It’s not yet too late to
get him and reach Carbon Creek for the
noon train. Will you do it?”</p>

<p>“No, sergeant, I won’t. I’m loyal to my
country; but I’m loyal to my father too,
and I won’t betray him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I admire your pluck, but I’ll
have to take you— Will I, though?—is
it my duty? Say, boys!” he called to the
three private soldiers who had preceded
them; “boys, halt!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The men stopped and wheeled round to
face their commander.</p>

<p>“Soldiers,” he said, “you know why I’m
taking this boy. I considered his conduct
treasonable in not disclosing his father’s
hiding-place. But I find that in reality he
is just as loyal as any one of us, except that
he knows his father’s secret and refuses to
give it away. Now what shall we do with
him?”</p>

<p>They had reached a point in front of the
dwelling-house of Sarah Jane Stark. The
men looked in on the smooth green lawn,
and then away to the eastern hill range. But
before they had made up their minds how
to reply to the officer’s question, a woman,
coming down the walk from the house,
reached the gate where they were standing.
It was Sarah Jane Stark herself.</p>

<p>“What’s all this about?” she inquired.
“Bob Bannister, what are you doing here
with these soldiers?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been arrested, Miss Stark,” replied
Bob modestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“You? Arrested? Fudge! What does
the boy mean?” turning to the officer.</p>

<p>“It means, madam,” replied the sergeant
courteously but firmly, “that this
boy knows the whereabouts of Rhett Bannister,
whom we have orders to arrest, and
will not disclose them. We are taking him
to the provost-marshal.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To compel him to tell where his father
is, or punish him for his disobedience.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense! The boy isn’t to blame.
You’d do the same thing yourself in his
place. Besides there isn’t a more patriotic
citizen in Mount Hermon township than this
very boy. I know what I’m talking about.”</p>

<p>The sergeant doffed his cap.</p>

<p>“I believe you are more than half right,
madam,” he said. “I myself am inclined to
think that he may do us more good right
here at his home, as a somewhat remarkable
illustration of patriotism under difficulties,
than he would lying in a guard-house
living on bread and water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course he will! Mind you, I’ve no
excuses for his fool father. That man’s
making the mistake of his life. But this
boy is all right. Say, have you had breakfast,
any of you?”</p>

<p>“My men and I have not, and I do not
think young Bannister has. We will stop
at the Bennett House in the village long
enough for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense! The Bennett House!
You come right up here to the Sarah Jane
Stark house, and I’ll give you a better
breakfast than you’ll get at all the Bennett
Houses in the country, and it won’t cost you
a penny either.”</p>

<p>She turned up the path as she spoke, and,
after a moment of hesitation, the rest of the
party followed her. The delay, however,
gave the officer an opportunity to make a
whispered inquiry of Bob concerning her,
and, being thus assured of her integrity
and loyalty, he no longer hesitated to lead
his little party to her house.</p>

<p>“Now, you go right into the kitchen,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
she said, “all of you, and wash your hands,
and by the time you’ve done that, breakfast’ll
be ready.”</p>

<p>And Sarah Jane Stark was as good as
her word, and her breakfast was as good
as her promises. The pleasant sight of
it, and the fragrant odor of it, as they
entered the dining-room, was something
long to be remembered. When they were
all seated she turned abruptly to the sergeant.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Anderson,” he replied, “Stanley B.
Anderson.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sergeant Anderson, you ask a
blessing.”</p>

<p>The young fellow flushed to the tips of
his ears.</p>

<p>“I have never done such a thing,” he
said. “I beg you will excuse me. At my
home my mother always says grace. Will
you not say it here?”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will. And I want you all
to say ‘amen,’ every one of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>So they bowed their heads, and Sarah
Jane Stark said:—</p>

<p>“O Lord, make us thankful for this
food; confound the enemies of our country,
and give us charity in our hearts for all
men.”</p>

<p>And every one at the table responded
heartily, “Amen!”</p>

<p>It was a delicious breakfast and a delightful
occasion. They all said so afterward,
and many times afterward. In the hearts
of these boys in uniform Sarah Jane Stark
found a warm place at once. For they were
mere boys—not one of them was over
twenty-three, and this woman of middle
age, with her big heart, her bluff manner,
her solicitude for their comfort, her interest
in their stories of the war, her intense
patriotism, and withal her broad charity,
came suddenly into their lives, like a breath
from some bigger, better, sweeter world
than they had lived in, and they loved her.
And one day, in the following June, after
the battle and slaughter of Cold Harbor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
one of these poor fellows, lying on a rough
cot in a field hospital, dying from a dreadful
wound, dictated a last letter to his waiting
mother at home, and another to Sarah Jane
Stark at Mount Hermon. And when she
was old and wrinkled and gray, this dear
woman, who never had a child of her own,
would read over again that brief, pathetic
letter from the dying soldier boy of Cold
Harbor, and weep as she read.</p>

<p>So, after breakfast, they all went out into
the beautiful October morning, and down
the footpath to the gate where she had first
found them. And she shook hands with
every one of the young soldiers, and wished
them God-speed, and early and abundant
victory, and the blessings of a long peace.
Then she turned to Bob and said:—</p>

<p>“Now, you run along back home, and
put an end to your mother’s anxiety, and
tell your miserable father for me, that the
Lord has delivered him this once out of the
hands of the Philistines, so that he may
enter the armies of Abraham Lincoln like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
man, and fight for his country as he ought
to; and somehow—I can’t tell you why,
but somehow I have an intuition that he’s
going to do it.”</p>

<p>And the sergeant and the provost-guard
stood by and heard her and said never a
word.</p>

<p>So they parted. Sarah Jane Stark walked
back up the footpath, across the lawn, to
her comfortable home. The young soldiers,
refreshed, invigorated and high-spirited,
went swinging up through the streets of
Mount Hermon to their appointed rendezvous.
And Bob Bannister, with newer,
bigger thoughts in his mind, with his soul
filled with larger enthusiasms, with a determination
in his heart to break in some way,
any way, the galling bonds of disloyalty
that girded and girdled his own home,
went back free down the road by which he
had come an hour before, a prisoner of the
United States.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>A DESPERATE DECISION</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Through all of the day following
the breakfast at Sarah Jane Stark’s
house, indeed through most of the succeeding
night, the thought and ambition
loomed large in Bob Bannister’s mind and
heart, to lift, in some way, the dark cloud of
disloyalty that rested upon the household
he loved. His one hour with the soldiers
of the United States had inspired and inspirited
him to new and greater effort, to
the making of any sacrifice, in order to uphold
the honor of his country and his home.</p>

<p>In the night an idea came to him, suddenly,
brilliantly—he wondered he had
not thought of it before. To be sure, there
were some details to be worked out, some
difficulties to be overcome; but the plan
was feasible, he knew that, and, if he could
carry it into successful execution, his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
would have the price lifted from his head,
the honor of the family would be saved, and
he himself would have the joy of serving
his country.</p>

<p>So it was settled and he went to sleep.
On the following morning he went up to
Mount Hermon and drew from the bank
half of his savings. The money was paid
to him without question, as his father had
long before made formal release of his
legal right to it. It was money that he
himself had earned, most of it in former
years, by carrying the mail from the village
post-office to Rick’s Corners, the next settlement
to the east on the old North and
South Turnpike road. But when his father’s
pro-slavery and anti-war sentiments became
pronounced, Bob lost his position as
mail-carrier, and a boy whose father had
been among the first to enlist as a soldier
received the appointment.</p>

<p>As for his morning tasks at home that
day, he did them with a vigor and spirit
that surprised and pleased his father. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the afternoon he finished up little odds and
ends of work that had been awaiting his
leisure, and rearranged his small store of
keepsakes, treasures, valuables, things that
a boy of seventeen has accumulated and
looks upon with sentiment. Some articles,
outgrown by him or become useless, he
destroyed. He appeared to be making
ready for a long absence. But he did it all
so quietly, with so little ostentation, that
no suspicions were aroused on the part of
any member of his family.</p>

<p>Then, when everything was done, doubts
as to the wisdom of his contemplated course
began to assail his mind. What would his
father say? What would his mother do?
What would his little sister think? The
plan that had seemed so brilliant to him in
the darkness of the night loomed shadowy
and doubtful in the cold light of a dull
October day. He began to wish that there
were some one whom he could take into his
confidence; to whom he could outline the
project he had in mind, and from whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
could get good and seasonable advice. Well,
there was some one. There was Seth Mills.
He was old, to be sure; but he was absolutely
honest, his judgment was still good,
he had always been Bob’s father’s faithful
friend, and his mother’s kindest neighbor.
Besides, having no children of his own,
the old man always had set great store by
Bob, and the boy felt that, in any event,
he would get sympathy and disinterested
counsel. So he went to see Seth Mills. He
walked down along the path by the spring-house,
and across the meadow, and found
his neighbor in the barn-yard milking his
cows.</p>

<p>“Uncle Seth,” he said, “I’ve come to tell
you what I’m going to do, and see what
you think of it.”</p>

<p>The old man looked up but did not stop
his milking.</p>

<p>“Well, Robbie, what is it ye goin’ to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to war.”</p>

<p>The rich streams that had been piercing
the boiling white foam in the milk-pail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
suddenly ceased. The man’s hands relaxed
without falling, and he gazed at the boy as
if trying to comprehend his meaning.</p>

<p>“You—you goin’ to enlist?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve thought it all out. You know
my father. You know what he thinks
about the war and about the draft. You
know he’s been drafted and won’t go, and
says the soldiers can’t take him alive. Well,
Sergeant Anderson said that, defying the
draft that way, he’s classed as a deserter,
and when he’s caught he’s liable to be shot.
Now you know that isn’t a nice thing to
happen to your father. So I’ve decided to
do this. I’m going to Easton to see this
provost-marshal and offer to take my
father’s place as a drafted man, and go
wherever they choose to send me, provided
they’ll let him off. I think they will,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>For a moment the old man did not answer.
He seemed to be trying fully to comprehend
the situation. Then, suddenly,
he took it in. Rising to his feet as quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
as his rheumatic legs would let him, kicking
over his three-legged milking-stool in
the operation, and barely saving his pail
of milk from the same fate, he grasped Bob
heartily by the hand.</p>

<p>“Jest the thing!” he exclaimed, “jest
the thing! Here I’ve been layin’ awake
nights fur a week tryin’ to think up some
way o’ savin’ Rhett Bannister’s neck, an’
here you’ve gone an’ struck it the first time,
by cracky!”</p>

<p>“You think the plan’s all right, do you,
Uncle Seth?”</p>

<p>“Sound as a dollar, my boy, sound as a
dollar. They’ll take ye an’ glad to git ye.
To be sure, you’re a leetle mite under age,
but that won’t make no difference; you’re
big an’ strong, an’ you can carry a gun an’
fight with the best of ’em.”</p>

<p>“But, will they let father off?”</p>

<p>“Well, now I sh’d think they would.
They don’t want no copperheads in the
army, nor no deserters, nor—why, I sh’d
think they’d be tickled to death to swap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
him for you, an’ call good riddance to him.
That’s what I say.”</p>

<p>“It looks that way to me, too, Uncle Seth,
and I do want to help father and save him
if I can.”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ they’s another thing about it,
Robbie. S’posin’ ye git to go down there.
S’posin’ ye git to be one of Uncle Sam’s
soldiers a-fightin’ in the army. You think
your father’s goin’ to set down to hum
contented, an’ let his boy do the soldierin’?
No, sir-ee! that ain’t him. You mark my
words. In less’n ten days he’ll be down
there a-tryin’ to git to take your place stid
o’ your takin’ his’n. That’s what I say.
Now, you mark my words!”</p>

<p>But Bob did not quite believe that. The
most that he hoped to do was to relieve
his father from the effect of the draft and
the result of his disobedience to it. More
than that, of course, it would give him the
opportunity that he had longed for and
waited for, to fight for his country and his
country’s flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>So they talked it over, the boy and the
old man, and every moment they grew more
enthusiastic over the project and what it
was likely to accomplish.</p>

<p>“When ye goin’, Robbie?”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought—I thought I’d go
to-morrow morning, Uncle Seth. You see
I can’t very well let them know I’m going.
That would spoil it all. So I thought I’d
get up early to-morrow morning and slip
away before anybody was up, and catch
the early train at Carbon Creek. You don’t
think I ought to tell them before I go, do
you?”</p>

<p>“No, I s’pose not. But what’ll your ma
think when she finds you ain’t to home?
What’ll your pa say?”</p>

<p>“That’s the only thing about it that
worries me, Uncle Seth. When I’m once in
the army, and they know where I am and
what to expect, it won’t be so bad. But how
to ease their minds before they find out, I
don’t know. I’ve thought over it a good deal,
but I can’t quite make out how I’m going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to do it. I might leave a letter, but then
they’d know where I was going and likely
stop me before I got there. I might—say,
I’ll tell you what; I just happen to think
of it. Suppose you kind o’ happen along
there some time to-morrow forenoon, and
say to them that you know where I am
and where I’m going, and that it’s all
right; and if I don’t come back in a day or
two I’ll write and tell them all about it.
That’ll do, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Certain! I’ll put their minds to rest.
Jest leave that to me. They’ll know’t
when I tell ’em ye’re all right, ye air all
right.”</p>

<p>Then, for a minute, the old man stood
silent, chewing contemplatively on a straw.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said finally, “as I’d
ort to encourage ye in this thing. Mebbe
it ain’t jest right. It’s a-goin’ ag’inst yer
father’s wish an’ will. It’s a-makin’ yer
mother an awful lot of anxiety. Mebbe it
won’t amount to nothin’ anyway. Mebbe
they won’t take ye. Mebbe they won’t leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
him go free. Ef they do take ye, ye go to
war, an’ ye know, or else ye don’t know,
what war is. You’re jest a boy. You’ll
hev to suffer. You’ll see some hard times.
Ye ain’t use to it. Likely ye’ll git sick.
Mebbe ye’ll git swamp fever, an’ that’s
bad enough. Mebbe ye’ll git wounded,
crippled for life. Mebbe ye’ll git killed,
an’ yer body buried in a trench with a hundred
others, like they buried ’em at Antietam
an’ Gettysburg, an’ nobody never
know where ye lay, nor how ye died. It’s
awful, war is, it’s jest awful, an’ ye ortn’t
to go, unless ye realize what’s likely to happen
to ye; and I ortn’t to encourage ye in
goin’ unless I’m ready to shoulder the responsibility
fer what may happen, an’ I
ain’t quite ready to do that.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t want you to do that, Uncle
Seth. I know what I’m about. I’ve thought
it all out. I’ve thought about every dreadful
thing that can possibly happen to me.
But before I get through thinking what may
happen to me, I begin to think about what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
is pretty sure to happen to my father if
things go on as they are. And then I can’t
hesitate any more. To have my father shot
as a deserter, why, that would be worse
for me, and worse for my mother, and for
my little sister all our lives, than it would
be to have me tired, or hungry, or sick, or
wounded, or shot to death in battle and
buried in a trench. And besides that I want
to go for the sake of going. I want to do
something for my country. Abraham Lincoln
wants more soldiers, and if he wants
them he should have them. I’m ready to
go, and I’m going. I’ve made up my mind;
and you couldn’t discourage me, Uncle
Seth, if you talked a thousand years!”</p>

<p>In the gray October twilight the boy
stood erect, with flushed face and flashing
eyes. The spirit of the time had entered his
soul as it entered the souls of thousands of
other boys in those soul-stirring days, and,
like them, he was ready. Consequences
were of no moment. His country was calling,
his response rang fervent and true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>So Seth Mills spoke no more discouraging
words. But he put his hands on the boy’s
shoulders and looked up into his eyes, for
the boy was the taller of the two.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” he said, “and I’m wrong.
I hadn’t thought it was in ye. Go on. I’ll
stand back o’ ye. God bless ye, I’m proud
o’ ye!”</p>

<p>Tears came into the old man’s eyes as he
spoke, and coursed down the furrows in
his cheeks, and his own patriotic heart was
roused to a new pitch of loyalty.</p>

<p>When, at last, the final arrangement with
his old friend had been made, and the little
details of his departure were settled, and
the good-bys and hand-shaking were at an
end, and Bob turned back into the meadow-path
toward home, it was almost dark.</p>

<p>His father sat at the supper-table that
evening with apparent unconcern. He
knew that there were no provost-guards in
the neighborhood, no one with authority
to arrest or imprison him. For while it was
true that, in a sense, he was isolated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
midst of an intensely patriotic community,
he was, nevertheless, in more or less constant
communication with friends and
sympathizers who kept him well informed
as to the dangers which surrounded or approached
him. On this night he knew, for
instance, that Sergeant Anderson, with his
little squad of soldiers, had returned to
Easton, and that no other detail of troops
had as yet come into the county. He knew
also that means would be found to warn
him of the approach of an enemy long before
that enemy could reach him. So he
ate his supper with his family in peace, and
sat quietly at his table reading his paper
without apprehension of danger when Bob
started to go upstairs to bed.</p>

<p>“Good-by, father!” said the boy, standing
at the stair-door with his lamp in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Good-<em>by</em>,” repeated his father, “what
do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Did I say good-by? I meant to say
good-night. But you know I never go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
bed at night any more, father, without
thinking that something may happen before
morning to separate us—forever.”</p>

<p>His lip trembled a little as he spoke, and
he still stood, hesitating, at the stair-door.</p>

<p>“Well, Robert, nothing will happen to-night,
I know. You can go to bed without
fear to-night. To-morrow, maybe, danger
will come again, we cannot tell. But to-night,
I believe we are safe.”</p>

<p>He saw that, for some reason, the boy’s
emotions were deeply stirred, and he imagined
it was due to a suddenly augmented
fear of what might happen to his father.</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything, do you,
Bob?” he inquired suddenly. “You haven’t
heard of danger immediately at hand?
Did Seth Mills tell you anything that
would lead you to think—?”</p>

<p>“No, father, oh no! I was just—well, I
won’t worry about you to-night, anyway.
But if anything <em>should</em> happen that we don’t
see each other again—for a good while—I’d
like to have you think that while I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in Abraham Lincoln, and in the Union,
and in the war, I believe in you, too, and I
wouldn’t want, ever, to do anything that
would seem to be disloyal to you.”</p>

<p>“No, Bob, of course not. I believe that.
I’m sorry these Northern notions of patriotism
have entered so deeply into your
mind. But, when you’re older and understand
things better, you’ll think differently.
There, go along to bed, now. You’re tired
and nervous to-night. In the morning
you’ll feel better.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand and Bob came over
and clasped it tightly.</p>

<p>“Good-night, father!”</p>

<p>“Good-night!”</p>

<p>The boy went on to bed, and Rhett Bannister
resumed his reading. But he could
keep neither his mind nor his eyes on the
printed page. He was thinking of his son
upstairs. Once a sudden and startling
thought came to him, more by way of intuition
than suggestion. He dropped his
book, rose to his feet, and stood staring at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the door through which Bob had gone.
But a sound of voices came to him faintly
down the stairway, natural, reassuring
voices, and after a minute he sat down
again and took up his book, and whatever
apprehensive thought it was that had so
suddenly and strangely entered his mind,
he dismissed it and resumed his reading.</p>

<p>Upstairs Bob had found his mother sitting
with Louise, who had long been asleep,
and sewing. It seemed to him that when
his mother was not busy about something
else she was always sewing. He entered the
room where she sat, and looked at her a
moment before speaking. The anxiety of
the last few months, the harassing dread
of the last few days, had worn her greatly
and left her haggard and pale. Bob was
almost shocked as he gazed on her face
under the lamplight. He had never seen
her look so before. Would his conduct of
the morrow bring to her added sorrow, or
intense relief? He dared not stop to think
about it then. He knew simply that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
was doing right and could not change his
plans.</p>

<p>“Good-night, mother!” he said. “I’m
going to bed.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, Robbie! Come here and
kiss me.”</p>

<p>He went where she was, and leaned over,
and she put her hands on his shoulders and
kissed him. He started to go away, but at
the door of the room he turned back.</p>

<p>“Mother, if anything should happen to-night,—we
don’t know what may happen
these days,—but if anything should happen,
and I had to do something, I don’t
want you ever to think but that I felt I was
doing the right thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Robbie, yes. I don’t know just
what you mean, but I know you mean to
do what is right. And these are dreadful
days, and dreadful nights. I don’t know
how it’s all going to end. I’m in terror
all the time. I wish your father could do
something, or you could do something, or
somebody could do something to help us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
If this keeps on I shall die! Oh, why don’t
they stop this cruel, <em>cruel</em> war!”</p>

<p>Bob went back into the room and put his
arms about his mother’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“There, mother, there. It’s terrible!
I know it’s terrible. I wish the war would
stop. I wish I could do something to stop
it. Maybe I can, just a little. But the only
way to stop it is to give Abraham Lincoln
enough soldiers to defeat the Southern
armies. We must do that. At any sacrifice,
we <em>must</em> do it. And, mother, I shall do my
part.”</p>

<p>She did not appreciate the significance
of his words, but she wiped the tears from
her eyes and said:—</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s think about it any more
to-night, Robbie.” And she kissed him
again, and again she took up her sewing.</p>

<p>Bob went over to Louise, who was stirring
uneasily in her sleep, and kissed her
gently, and went out into the hall. At the
door he turned to look once more at his
mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-night, mother!” he said, “and
good dreams. I think we shall all be happier
soon.”</p>

<p>He went to his room, removed his working-clothes,
put on his best suit, got together
a few things and put them into a
little hand-bag that had once belonged to
his South Carolinian grandfather, put out
his light, and threw himself down on the
bed for a brief sleep. But he slept only fitfully,
looking often at his watch by the
light of the moon that shone in at his window;
and at last, at four o’clock, he rose
for the last time, took his satchel and shoes
in his hands and crept softly downstairs.
He went through by the kitchen, stopping
there to bathe his face and hands, then,
sliding back the bolt, he opened the door
and stepped out on to the porch. The moon
was shining brightly, and the night was
very still. There were as yet no signs of
morning in the east, nor any noise of stirring
men or beasts. He bethought himself
of food, but he feared lest, by moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
around in the darkness of the pantry to
seek it, he would arouse some of the inmates
of the house. So he closed the door
behind him, sat down on the porch-steps
and put on his shoes, and then, satchel in
hand, he started down the garden pathway
to the kitchen gate. The windows of
the sleeping-room occupied by Louise
opened on this side of the house, but there
was no possibility of his being seen by her.
Once in the road, he turned his face toward
Mount Hermon. When he reached the
front gate, he stopped and looked up the
path toward the house. From his mother’s
window shone the faint light of her night-lamp.
There were no other signs of life
about the premises. Then, suddenly, there
in the shadow of the trees, with his boyhood
home in front of him, and in the dark west
toward which his footsteps were pointing
a fate which no man could fathom, a feeling
of profound depression fell upon him,
a sense of unutterable loneliness and desolation.
For the time being all of his courage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
all of his determination, all of his invincible
patriotism, deserted him and left
him weak and homesick and miserable.
In another moment he would have turned
back and sought the safety and protection
which his dear home offered him; but, even
as he hesitated, out of the darkness of the
east there grew slowly and solemnly clear
to his mental vision the tall, gaunt form,
the sadly resolute and rugged face of Abraham
Lincoln. And, with the vision, there
came back into his mind, one by one and
then all together, the overpowering reasons
that had led him into taking this momentous
step. So his judgment returned, his
thought grew clear, courage came back to
him, and strength, and deep determination,
and he turned his face once more toward
Mount Hermon, and plunged ahead into
the shadows.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>OFF TO THE WAR</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">By the time Bob reached the village
the sky was gray along the eastern
horizon, and a faint tinge of pink, seen
through a gap in the hill-range, announced
the coming of the sun. In front of the gate
of Sarah Jane Stark he stopped, and looked
longingly up at her house. Light shone
from two of her lower windows, and a wisp
of blue smoke curled lazily from the southern
chimney. He thought he would like
to go in and tell Miss Stark what he was
about to do. He wondered what she would
say if she knew. He felt, in his heart, that
she would approve his course and bid him
God-speed. However, there was not time
to visit her. He wanted to get through the
village before daybreak, so that he should
not be seen of many people. So he gripped
his satchel and hurried on. At the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
corner he turned out of the main street,
and skirted the closely built portion of the
town by an outlying way. He met no one
whom he knew until he came in again to
the main traveled highway beyond the town.
This road led directly to the railroad station
at Carbon Creek. It had been his purpose
to wait here for the stage that left Mount
Hermon every morning for Carbon Creek,
carrying passengers and mail. But he was
in no mood to stand still, and, besides, the
chilly October air made exercise a necessity.
So he walked quickly along, feeling that
the farther from Mount Hermon he could
get the safer he would be. It was broad
daylight now, and the stage was likely to
overtake him at any moment. He began to
wonder whom he would have for fellow
passengers. But, even as he wondered, a
horse and buggy, coming up rapidly from
behind, was about to pass him, when the
man who was driving turned in his seat and
looked back at Bob. When he saw who it
was, he reined up his horse and called out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Bob Bannister! is that you?
Where are you going? Won’t you jump in
and ride?”</p>

<p>It was Henry Bradbury who spoke, the
crippled veteran who had left an arm at
Malvern Hill in ’62, and who had declared
that he would gladly have left both arms, or
even his life, if only “Little Mac” could have
taken Richmond as the climax of that unfortunate
Peninsular Campaign. For, somehow,
after that campaign, McClellan, whom
he, with a hundred thousand other soldiers,
had worshiped as the one splendid hero of
the war, lost lustre in his eyes, and never
regained it to that November night, when,
at Warrenton, Virginia, he was relieved
from the command of the Army of the
Potomac. And yet, to this day, Henry
Bradbury will not permit any one, in his
presence, to speak harshly of McClellan.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mr. Bradbury,” replied
Bob, very much confused. “I’m not
going far. I was just waiting for the stage
to come along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, if you’re going to Carbon Creek
you might just as well jump in and ride
with me. I’ve got lots of room and you’ll
save your stage fare.”</p>

<p>Bob hesitated for a moment. He did not
know what embarrassing questions the
veteran might ask. Then, suddenly, he
made up his mind to accept the invitation.</p>

<p>“I will go with you, Mr. Bradbury,”
he said. “I think I would a good deal
rather go with you than in the stage.”</p>

<p>He climbed into the wagon and they
started on, the old soldier driving with one
hand with great ease and facility.</p>

<p>“I might as well be plain with you, Bob,”
he said. “I don’t think much of your father,
but I’ve got nothing against you. In
fact, if what they tell me about your loyalty
is true, you deserve a good deal of credit,
and I wouldn’t be the last one to give it to
you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Bradbury! My father
and I don’t quite agree about the war, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
about—the draft, but I don’t want to set
up my judgment as better than his, and I
don’t want to criticise him, and I’d rather
not hear anybody else do it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, my boy. I’m afraid his
obstinacy is going to cost him his neck, but
I don’t know as I’ve got any call to try
to set his son against him. Let’s change
the subject. Going up to the station, are
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Going to take the train?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I expect to.”</p>

<p>After that for a few minutes there was
silence. Bradbury looked Bob over carefully
to see if perchance there might be something
about his dress or appearance to indicate
his errand. But there was nothing.
Finally his curiosity prevailed, and he
said:—</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be inquisitive, but may
I ask where you are going?”</p>

<p>“I want to go to Easton, Mr. Bradbury.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another pause, followed by
another question.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s none o’ my business,
but can I inquire if Rhett Bannister has decided
to give himself up?”</p>

<p>“I think not, Mr. Bradbury. He don’t
change his mind very easily after he’s
once made it up.”</p>

<p>The veteran was puzzled. What was Bob
Bannister going to Easton for? His visit
there must in some way be connected with
the provost-marshal’s office and the draft.
He could have no other errand. Then,
suddenly, a light broke in upon Henry
Bradbury’s mind. He reined his horse up
sharply and turned to face the boy.</p>

<p>“Look here, Bob Bannister! are you
going to enlist?”</p>

<p>Bob hardly knew how to reply. He considered
the question for a moment before
he answered it.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said finally, “I thought one
of us ought to go to the war, Mr. Bradbury.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The man dropped his reins and grasped
Bob’s hand.</p>

<p>“You’re all right!” he exclaimed. “I
wish Abe Lincoln had a hundred thousand
more just like you. Richmond would be
ours in thirty days.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Bradbury, nobody knows what
I’m going to do, and I wish you wouldn’t
tell. Maybe I’ll not be able to do it, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Mum’s the word. Don’t your folks
know?”</p>

<p>“No. I couldn’t have gone if they
knew.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Well, my boy, Henry
Bradbury says God bless you! Do you
hear? God bless you!”</p>

<p>So, after the ice had been thus broken,
Bob explained fully the project he had in
mind; there were a score of things to be
talked about, a hundred questions to be
asked on either side, and a hundred answers
to be given. And before they were quite
aware of it they had reached the station at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Carbon Creek. But the train would not be
due yet for nearly an hour. Learning that
Bob had not had his breakfast, the veteran
compelled him to go across the road with
him to the Eagle Hotel.</p>

<p>“Get up the best breakfast you know
how for this young man and me,” he said
to the landlord. “Ham and eggs and potatoes
and biscuits and pancakes and coffee
and all the fixin’s. I want you to remember,”
he added to Bob, “I want you to remember,
some morning when you’re eating
hard-tack and salt pork, and drinking
black and muddy coffee,—I want you to
remember the breakfast Henry Bradbury
bought for you at the Eagle Hotel at Carbon
Creek the morning you started for the
war.”</p>

<p>And Bob did remember it. Many times
he remembered it in the days that were
to come.</p>

<p>In due time the stage pulled up at the
station, the train came in, and Bob said
good-by to his veteran friend and stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
on board. He had but one change of cars
to make, the one at Scranton, and, late in
the afternoon, he reached Phillipsburg
and walked across the river to Easton. The
provost-marshal’s office was already closed
for the day, and Bob had to content himself
with finding a modest hotel where he could
stay over night and wait patiently for what
the morning might bring. After supper
he strolled out into the street. Reaching
the public square, he saw a hundred newly
arrived drafted men formed into a company
and drilled in military movements.
They were very awkward, indeed. Bob
thought that the company of boys at home
could have done far better. But, later in the
evening, when a body of seasoned veterans,
belonging to the invalid corps, reached the
city, and marched, with fine precision, up
the street to the square, and stacked their
arms and were dismissed, he looked upon
them with deep admiration. This was
something like. The moving ranks, the
rhythmic tramp, the glistening arms, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
stirring music of the fife and drum, all this
had a fascination for the boy such as he had
never experienced before. When the troops
were dismissed one of the officers, meeting
and greeting a comrade on the corner where
Bob was waiting, stood for a moment and
talked with him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bob heard him say, “we’ve got
a little provost duty to do up in this end of
the state. There were a good many in some
sections who didn’t respond to the draft.
Some of them are already in, the rest we’re
going to round up. One of the most notorious
of these fellows is a man by the name
of Bannister. I’m going after him myself,
when I get through around here. I’ll give
him four days from now to make his peace
with Uncle Sam, and if he don’t do it something
will drop. I’m going after him and I
intend to get him, dead or alive.”</p>

<p>The soldiers passed on, and Bob, pale of
face and much troubled in heart, went back
to his hotel more determined than ever to
take his father’s place in the ranks if, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
any possible means, so desirable a substitution
could be made.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his anxiety and the
many noises in the streets, he slept fairly
well, and at nine o’clock on the following
morning he presented himself at the office
of the provost-marshal. Many were already
waiting to see that officer, and Bob
had to take his place in line and await his
turn. Most of those who swarmed about
the marshal’s office were drafted men who
were there to urge their claims for exemption
from service on account of physical
disability. Many were present with substitutes
whom they had hired to serve for
them. Some who had failed to respond to
the notice of draft were being brought in
by members of the provost-guard, to answer
for their neglect or disobedience.</p>

<p>When Bob’s turn finally came and he
was ushered into the provost-marshal’s
office, he did not quite know how to state
his errand. A man in captain’s uniform
sat behind a long table, busily writing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
There were two or three clerks in various
parts of the room, and soldiers with side-arms
stood guard at the door.</p>

<p>The provost-marshal looked up from
his writing and saw Bob.</p>

<p>“<a href="#image05">Well</a>,” he said, “<a href="#image05">what’s your case?</a>”</p>

</div>

<p>“I haven’t any case,” replied Bob,
“except that I want to enlist in place of my
father, who has been drafted.”</p>

<p>“Go as a substitute, eh? Well, you want
to see Lieutenant Morrison about that,
in the next room. Your father is here, I
suppose,” he added, as Bob turned away.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Bob, “he isn’t. That’s
the trouble. Nor does he know I’m here.”</p>

<p>The captain laid down his pen and looked
at the boy curiously.</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” he said. “What’s the
reason he don’t know?”</p>

<p>Bob advanced a step closer to the marshal’s
table.</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t in sympathy with the
war. And when he was drafted he wouldn’t
report. And when the soldiers came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to arrest him he—they couldn’t find
him.”</p>

<p>“I see. And you—why did you come
without his knowledge?”</p>

<p>“Why, he wouldn’t have let me come
if he knew. And I, I believe in the war. I
want to be a soldier. And I thought if I
could just take his place so he could stay
home with mother and I could go and
fight—why, I thought it would be better
all around.”</p>

<p>“What’s your father’s name?”</p>

<p>“Bannister. Rhett Bannister.”</p>

<p>The marshal’s face clouded.</p>

<p>“Bannister of Mount Hermon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, my boy, but, figuratively
speaking, there’s a price on your father’s
head. He’s a notorious rebel sympathizer,
a regular secession firebrand. He has declared
that the government will never take
him alive. Very well, then, we’ll take him
dead. But we can’t afford to accept a price
for his freedom. Our orders are to get him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and we shall do it if it takes a regiment of
soldiers.”</p>

<p>The marshal took up his pen and made
as if to resume his writing.</p>

<p>“Then it’s no use,” inquired Bob weakly,
“for me to think about substituting for
him?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest, my boy. But if you
really want to serve your country, I’ll tell
you what you can do. You can enlist. We
need men and we’ll be glad to have you.
Any recruiting officer will take your application.
That’s all, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I guess so; yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well, good-morning! Let in the
next man, corporal.”</p>

<p>Bob left the office in a daze. The hope
that for two days had lain next his heart,
was suddenly blasted. He hardly knew
what to do or which way to turn. He walked
out through the crowd of waiting men, but
he scarcely saw them, nor did they notice
him. It was too common a sight in these
days to see disappointed men leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
marshal’s office, for any one to comment
on this particular boy’s downcast look or
halting step. He went out into the October
sunlight, and, threading his way through
throngs of citizens and soldiers, he walked
down the eastern side of the public square.
Well, it was all over. He had failed. His
errand had simply served to emphasize his
father’s disloyalty. What now? Should he
go home, or— The marshal had said
something about his enlisting, anyway.
How would that work? He had wandered
into the street leading to the bridge across
the Delaware. Suddenly he was aware that
a man in soldier’s uniform, whom he had
just met and passed, had stopped and
turned and was calling to him. Bob faced
about and looked. In an instant he recognized
the soldier as Sergeant Anderson,
who had arrested him and marched him
off to Sarah Jane Stark’s house for breakfast.</p>

<p>“Are you Bob Bannister?” asked the
sergeant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Bob, “and you are Sergeant
Anderson.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. But what in the world are you
doing here?”</p>

<p>“Why, I came here last night to— Well,
I might as well tell you; I thought they
would let me substitute for my father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I don’t believe you could do
that. Have you seen Captain Yohe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he wouldn’t let me.”</p>

<p>“I thought he wouldn’t. That’s too
bad after you came all the way here for
that purpose. It will be a disappointment
to your father, too.”</p>

<p>“He don’t know I came.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know you came! Why—say,
boy, did you work this thing out yourself?
Were you willing to do this?”</p>

<p>“Willing! I’d ’a’ crawled from Mount
Hermon on my hands and knees to be allowed
to do it. I want to save my father,
Sergeant Anderson. And I want to help
my country. I thought I was going to do
both, and now I can’t do either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s too bad!”</p>

<p>“Say, do you suppose I could enlist?
The marshal suggested that I might enlist.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I suppose you could. How
old are you?”</p>

<p>“Seventeen my last birthday.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a little under age, but I
guess you can get in. Uncle Sam needs
soldiers pretty bad. I guess they’ll take
you.”</p>

<p>“I believe I’ll try it. It looks this way
to me. If I get to be a soldier and have a
good record, then if they do get father,
whatever happens to him it won’t be quite
so bad for the rest of us if I’ve proved my
loyalty.”</p>

<p>“That’s right! I don’t believe you’re
going to help him by enlisting, but if worst
comes to worst men are going to forget
your father’s disgrace in thinking of your
bravery. Will you do it? Will you enlist?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sergeant Anderson, I will.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you what to do. You go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
with me. In an hour I shall start back to
the South to join my regiment. I’ll take
you along. I’ll get you into my company.
I’ll get you into my mess. I’ll stand by
you, and take care of you, and share with
you, because you’re a hero already, and
I’m proud of you!”</p>

<p>The sergeant’s eyes dimmed as he
grasped the boy’s hand and shook it enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” replied Bob. “I’m no
hero; and I may disgrace you; but I’ll go,
and I’ll do the very best I can.”</p>

<p>“Good! Be at the depot across the bridge
yonder in an hour, and I’ll meet you there.
The train leaves at eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>The sergeant hurried away, and Bob
went back to his hotel to get his baggage.
It occurred to him to write a brief letter
to Seth Mills, and he did so, telling him
what had happened at Easton and giving
him permission to repeat to his father and
mother so much or so little of the information
as he saw fit. Then he hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to the railroad station and there, promptly
at the hour agreed upon, he met Sergeant
Anderson. At eleven o’clock they boarded
the train for Harrisburg, and from thence,
with little delay, they went to Washington.
It was late at night when they reached the
capital city, and Bob was very tired. They
passed through the jostling crowds at the
railroad station and sought a rooming house,
not far away, with which Sergeant Anderson
was familiar, stopping on the way to
get a meagre luncheon at a near-by restaurant.
They were not long in seeking their
beds, and they had no sooner laid themselves
down than the young officer fell into
a heavy and restful sleep.</p>

<p>But Bob was not so fortunate. The
events of the day were still very fresh and
vivid in his mind, and he could not readily
dismiss the memory of them. It had all
been so novel, so exciting, so nerve-racking,
for this boy of seventeen, who never
before in his life had been fifty miles distant
from his native town. Yet he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
discontented or unhappy. On the contrary,
so far as the wisdom of his course was concerned,
his mind was perfectly at rest. His
only anxiety was on account of his father
and mother, who would be worrying about
him at home. Yet he felt that he had done
right. Whatever now might happen to his
father, permanent escape from the Federal
authorities, or arrest, imprisonment, and
death, he knew that his own record as a
Union soldier would help to save the family
from complete disgrace. Moreover, the
ambition of years was about to be realized,
he was soon to be enlisted in the ranks of
his country’s soldiers, and march and
fight under the folds of the old flag. So,
with this thought in his mind to temper
the anxiety for his father in his heart, he
fell into a calmer, deeper sleep than he
had known before in many months.</p>

<p>It was late when they arose the next
morning, and, after a hurried breakfast,
went out into the streets. It was Bob’s first
visit to Washington, and he was deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
impressed by the sights and sounds that
surrounded him. There were many people
moving to and fro. Small bodies of troops
went marching by. Officers in uniform
hurried here and there. Hospital wagons
carrying sick and wounded men brought
in from the front, went trailing through the
streets. Everywhere was noise, bustle, activity,
color. Yet nowhere was there gayety.
There was no laughter, no lightness of
look or word, no care-free expression on
the face of any passer-by. For Washington
was troubled. Meade, who had been
driven back almost half-way from the
Rappahannock to the capital, under the
repeated onslaughts of Lee’s depleted but
still daring and determined armies, was
just now taking fresh courage, facing his
troops about, and turning back once more
from Centreville toward the Rapidan. Yet
the shadow of unnecessary retreat and imminent
danger still rested on the city, and
complete confidence had not been restored
in the commander and the army that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
fought so splendidly and successfully at
Gettysburg in July. Even Sergeant Anderson,
usually buoyant and light-hearted,
seemed to partake of the prevailing depression,
and as he and Bob made their
way down to the river and across Long
Bridge, little was said by either of them.</p>

<p>At the end of the bridge a supply wagon
going down to Alexandria came along, and
the driver, who knew Sergeant Anderson,
gave both men a ride with him to the Virginia
city.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon one of the trains
that ran at irregular intervals from Alexandria
to the front was made up, and Anderson,
having the necessary passports,
was able to procure a ride for his companion
and himself. At Bristol station he made
inquiry and learned that his regiment had
gone on to Gainesville, and thence to Auburn,
and so the two men followed after on
foot. That night, as guests of the rear-guard,
they slept, rolled in blankets, in an
open field. It was not until late the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
morning that they came up with Anderson’s
regiment, camped under the shelter
of a low hill-range near Auburn.</p>

<p>The sergeant, beloved by the men of his
company for his bravery in battle, and his
cheerfulness and gentleness in camp and
on the march, was heartily welcomed back.
And his recommendation of Bob was an
open sesame for the boy into the good graces
of the entire command. So it happened
that, before nightfall, Bob Bannister, duly
examined, passed, mustered, and clothed
in uniform, became a soldier in the Army
of the Potomac.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>A LETTER FROM THE FRONT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There was consternation in the house
of Bannister. The son of the house
had disappeared over night. His mother
was distracted, his father was anxious and
angry. The morning wore on and he did
not return. No one had seen him nor could
any trace of him be found. Toward noon
Seth Mills came over. He was able to quiet,
to some extent, the apprehension concerning
the boy. But he would not tell where
Bob had gone.</p>

<p>“The boy knows what he’s a-doin’,” said
the old man, “and he’s perfectly safe. He
won’t git back to-night. He may be back
to-morrow night—I don’t know. Ef he
don’t come till the day after, I’ll tell ye
more about ’im. He’s on the right track
an’ he’s able to take keer of ’imself, an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
some day ye’re a-goin’ to be proud o’ that
boy, both of ye. That’s what I say.”</p>

<p>He stood up very straight and rapped his
cane three times on the floor for emphasis
and turned toward the door. With this
statement and this promise the Bannisters
had to be satisfied. They knew, from long
experience, that the old man could not be
forced to tell more than he chose. So the
day dragged on. Rhett Bannister had not
been so unhappy before in all his life. A
dozen times he thought of starting out to
find his son, and a dozen times he abandoned
the idea. A dozen times he felt that
he must go over and choke the truth out
of old Seth Mills, and as often he restrained
himself. He surmised something of what
had happened, and what he surmised hurt
and angered him.</p>

<p>The day went by, and the night, and the
next day, and Bob did not return. The
next night a candle shone all night from
the porch-window, that the boy might be
guided safely to his door, if haply he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
come back, and all night Rhett Bannister
lay sleepless and perplexed. The next
morning he started out to find Seth Mills.
It was the first time in two weeks that he
had left his own premises. He met the old
man in the road, hobbling toward the
Bannister home.</p>

<p>“Seth,” he said, “I want you to tell me
where Robert has gone, and I want you to
tell me now. Do you hear? <em>now!</em>”</p>

<p>His voice rose in anger as he spoke, a
look of determination was in his eyes, and
the old man knew that the time had come
when he must reveal his secret.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied deliberately, “I was
jes’ comin’ over to tell ye. I think it’s time
now ye ort to know. Well, sir, the night
before he left, Bob come an’ told me ’at he
was a-goin’ to Easton to try to pervail on
the provost-marshal there to let him go as
a substitute in your place. Ef he ain’t
back to-day I expect they’ve let him do it.
Now you’ve got it, Rhett Bannister, straight
from the shoulder; make the most of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment Bannister did not reply.
His worst fear had been realized. A great
wave of indignation and anger swept over
his soul. He stood over the bent form of
his old neighbor, white-faced and quivering.</p>

<p>“And you!” he cried, “you of all men,
to encourage him, to assist him in this rebellious,
this disgraceful, this suicidal folly!”</p>

<p>And again the old man stood up very
straight.</p>

<p>“I did encourage him,” he replied. “And
I glory in his grit. And ef you hed one drop
of human blood in your veins, you’d be the
proudest father on the Lord’s footstool
to-day.”</p>

<p>Then, lest in his wrath he should wholly
forget himself, Bannister turned on his
heel and strode away. But he did not go
immediately to his home. He felt that he
could not yet trust himself to tell his wife.
And when, finally, he did go to her he found
that she already knew. Seth Mills had been
there and told her that since he had seen her
husband he had received a letter from Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
saying that he had been refused as a substitute,
but that he was about starting to
the front with Sergeant Anderson to enlist.
Then Rhett Bannister lost entire control of
his tongue.</p>

<p>“So,” he said, “the radicals have caught
their prey at last. Such Lincoln bigots as
Seth Mills and Henry Bradbury and
Sarah Jane Stark have drilled into the boy’s
mind their brand of pestilent patriotism
till they have turned his head and sent him
off on this wild-goose chase after glory.
Little thought have they for his health or
life or the peace of mind of his parents.
And when he dies, as die he will, in that
awful struggle, his blood will be on their
heads. Oh, it’s horrible! horrible!”</p>

<p>He had not thought to give way, like this,
to his passion, and the next moment he had
repented himself of his anger. His wife had
thrown herself into a chair, and, resting her
head on a table, was sobbing hysterically.
He went over to her and put his arms about
her shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“There, Mary,” he said, “there, never
mind. We’ll get him back somehow. He’s
too young to enlist. They can’t hold him
against his will or ours. We’ll get him back.”</p>

<p>And so, little by little, she was calmed
and comforted.</p>

<p>Seth Mills had told her that Bob would
write as soon as he reached his destination.
But the day went by and the night wore
away and no letter came. Another day and
another night dragged their long hours out,
and still there was no letter. Word reached
Bob’s parents from those who had seen
him on the way to Easton. Congratulations
on their son’s patriotism and bravery came
to them in almost every mail. Henry Bradbury
wrote to Bannister:—</p>

<p>“If you are not proud of your boy, you
ought to be. I saw him when he started.
A braver boy never left this town. If you
hang for treason, he will redeem your family
from disgrace. Get down on your knees
and thank God for him.”</p>

<p>And some of these darts sank deeply into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Rhett Bannister’s sensitive soul. At times
he was wild with rage, at other times he
was bowed and silent with grief and despair.
His own fate mattered little to him
any more. His whole thought was as to
when and by what method he could rescue
his son from the hateful hands into which
he had fallen. But, even as he pondered and
grieved, there crept into his heart a softer
feeling toward the boy, an almost unconscious
sympathy with the enthusiasm, the
ambition, the noble unselfishness which
had governed the lad’s conduct, which had
impelled him to seek his father’s welfare
at peril of his own, which had led him willingly,
gladly into the ranks of the Union
armies. Indeed, he went so far as to wonder
if he himself could by any possibility
be mistaken in his attitude toward the
Federal government, and his view concerning
the conduct of the war. If, after all,
there might not possibly be something back
of all this attempt at coercion, back of all
these vast fighting armies in blue, back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
all this lavish expenditure of blood and
treasure, some great principle, some high
ideal, which his eyes had been too dim to
see, but which appealed to the hearts and
souls of large-minded men, and fervent
patriotic youth, and led them into untold
sacrifices that that principle might be upheld
and that ideal maintained.</p>

<p>On the fifth day after Bob’s disappearance,
the boy who brought mail from the
post-office to the residents along the North
and South Turnpike road, left a letter at
the Bannister house, a letter which, at the
first glance, Mrs. Bannister knew was from
Bob. With trembling hands she tore the
envelope apart and drew forth the sheet of
paper inclosed. In her calmer moments she
could have read the letter without difficulty.
Now, the words, strangely twisted and distorted,
swam before her eyes, and the
whole page was an unsolved mystery. She
ran to the door calling to her husband:—</p>

<p>“Rhett! Rhett! Here’s a letter—from
Rob—come quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>At his bench in the shop he heard her,
and hurried to her side. She thrust the
letter into his hands.</p>

<p>“Read it!” she exclaimed. “Read it
aloud!”</p>

<p>So he read it.</p>

<p class="noi">“<span class="smcap">My dearest Father and Mother</span>:—</p>

<p>“I know I gave you a good deal of anxiety
and distress. I am very sorry for that,
but I thought I was doing what was right
and now I know I was. I wrote Uncle Seth
about it. I suppose he has told you. They
wouldn’t take me as a substitute for father,
so I thought I would enlist anyway, and I
met Sergt. Anderson at Easton, and he
brought me down here and got me into his
company. The only regret I have is that
father isn’t here with me as a soldier. I
am so anxious and fearful about him. It
is such a splendid thing to be a soldier of
the United States. I am so happy, all except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
about father. We marched here to-day
from Auburn. We are in camp here.
They say Gen. Meade may take us on
down to Fredericksburg and have a battle
there. I am very well and happy. Oh,
mother, do you remember how the boys
wouldn’t have me in the company last
summer, and how bad I felt about it? Well,
they are still in Mount Hermon playing
soldier with wooden swords and guns, and
now I am in the army with a real musket
and knapsack and canteen, and maybe to-morrow
or next day I shall go into a real
battle to fight for my country. Oh, mother,
I’m so proud of being a soldier. I am in
Col. Gordon’s regiment, Co. M, Army of
the Potomac, Va. Please write to me. I
am so sorry I gave you anxiety about me,
but I couldn’t help it. If anything happens
to father, tell me. If he could only be
here and see things the way I do. Give my
dear love to Dottie.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>When he had finished reading the letter,
the man held it in his hand and said nothing.
Neither did he see anything in the
room about him. His eyes were piercing
the distance, gazing on a blue-coated stripling
in Meade’s army down among the Virginia
hills.</p>

<p>The woman was the first to speak. There
was no longer in her face the strain of grief
or anxiety, the steady look of pain. Her
eyes were shining and tearless. Her hands
were clasped.</p>

<p>“Rhett,” she said, “I’m proud of him.
He’s the bravest boy in the world. What
a splendid, splendid letter!”</p>

<p>For one moment the mother’s pride in
her offspring asserted itself, the spirit of
her Kentucky ancestors shone forth in her
countenance, and she spoke the words that
came straight from her heart to her lips.
Then, suddenly realizing that for the first
time in all their twenty years of married
life, she had expressed a thought in direct
antagonism to the opinion of the husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
whom she honored and loved, she sank
back into a chair, pale-faced and silent,
and let her hands fall dejectedly to her
side.</p>

<p>But there was no protest from him. Instead,
with a look in his eyes which she
could not quite fathom, he came over and
sat down by her and kissed her and said:—</p>

<p>“We are both proud of his spirit, Mary,
however mistaken his conduct. But he is
too good a boy for us to permit him to be
lost and destroyed in this awful whirlpool
of war. We must get him back.”</p>

<p>Late in the evening of that day there came
a knock at the kitchen door of the Bannister
house. When the door was opened some
one from the outer darkness thrust in a
scrap of paper and disappeared. On the
paper was scrawled:—</p>

<p>“Rounding-up squad expected at Scranton
to-night. Look out!”</p>

<p>When Rhett Bannister read the warning,
he said:—</p>

<p>“It makes little difference now. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
simply hastens my departure. Doubtless
the end will be the same.”</p>

<p>To his wife he added:—</p>

<p>“I start to-morrow morning to try to
reach Robert. The probability is that I
shall not succeed. But the least I can do
is to make the effort.”</p>

<p>Then, gently, calmly, carefully, he outlined
to his wife the plan that he had in
mind, and explained to her why there was
nothing left for him to do but to try to
reach and save the boy. The effort might
cost him his life, but to stay at home was
likely also to cost him his life, and to attempt
to escape from the Federal authorities
was utterly useless. There was a wild
possibility, the thousandth part of a chance,
that he might get to Bob and be able to take
the boy’s place in the ranks. That was all.
And when it was all said, he did not find
her nerveless, or hysterical, or in tears, as
he had expected and feared, but, instead,
in her eyes there was a look of resolution
and bravery, across her gentle lips there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
was drawn a line of courage and determination
such as, in all their married life, he
had never seen there before.</p>

<p>“I am content,” she said. “I believe you
are doing right. Rhett, dear, no matter
what happens now, come life or death or
desolation, I shall have two heroes to worship
and dream of as long as I live.”</p>

<p>Strange it is, and divine, that in a
woman so weak so strong a spirit will develop
when the right hour strikes.</p>

<p>So, in the bleak darkness of the next
morning, at the same hour on which his son
had left home scarcely a week before,
Rhett Bannister kissed his wife and his
sleeping child good-by, and set forth on a
mission which, even in his most hopeful
moments, promised him only bitter and
disastrous failure.</p>

<p>Up the dark road, in the face of the chill
October wind, he hurried, into the streets
of Mount Hermon, past the home of Sarah
Jane Stark, making the same détour
around the village that Bob had made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
coming out into the main road where he
had come, hurrying on in the gray light of
the morning, toward his hoped-for destination.
But, farther on, he left the main highway
and struck off across the country by a
little-traveled road, expecting to reach a
way station on the railroad a few miles
beyond Carbon Creek, and there meet the
morning train.</p>

<p>In this effort he was successful. He met
no one on the way, nor did any one at
the station recognize him. But he had
no sooner boarded the train than that
happened which he might have expected.
Soldiers in uniform arose mysteriously and
one stood guard at each door of the car,
and another one, followed by an officer,
came down the aisle and stopped at the
conscript’s seat.</p>

<p>“Is your name Bannister?” inquired the
officer.</p>

<p>“It is,” responded the man. “Rhett
Bannister of Mount Hermon, at your service;
drafted by the government, classed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
as a deserter, and on my way to join the
Army of the Potomac in Virginia.”</p>

<p>“Good! you are our prisoner. Have you
any arms about you?”</p>

<p>The officer hastily and skillfully examined
the prisoner’s clothing.</p>

<p>“I am unarmed and defenseless,” replied
Bannister. “I will go with you willingly.
I am not disappointed nor surprised.
I only ask to be heard by any officer in authority
before whom you take me.”</p>

<p>The mode of capture had been simple
enough. The provost-guard had only to
follow the conscript’s trail, to board the
train at Carbon Creek, and be ready to apprehend
him when he should appear. They
did not handcuff him. He was entirely
in their power, and it was apparent that he
would make no resistance.</p>

<p>And so the notorious copperhead, the
man who had denounced Abraham Lincoln,
who had ridiculed the draft, who had defied
the Federal army, was at last a prisoner of
the United States. Within five minutes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
fact of his identity was known to every person
on the train. Men hissed and jeered at
him as he was taken into an adjoining
car, and women looked on him with detestation.
At a station where a change of
cars was made, a sympathizer, with more
zeal than discretion, attempted, in a loud
voice, to argue justification for the prisoner.
But his oratory was soon drowned in a
storm of protest, and he himself was buffeted
by the crowd till he was glad to escape.</p>

<p>So, all the way to Easton, the despised
conscript was mocked and frowned upon.
Accustomed as he had been to condemnation
by his fellow men, the experience of
this day was the most bitter and degrading
that his life had thus far known. With
little to eat, and no comfortable resting-place,
he passed a sleepless night. In the
morning he was brought before the provost-marshal.</p>

<p>“Captain Yohe,” said the officer in
charge, “this is Rhett Bannister, the Mount
Hermon deserter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The provost-marshal laid down his pen
and looked the prisoner in the face.</p>

<p>“Your son,” he said, “was before me a
few days ago seeking to be substituted in
your place. Were you aware of that fact?”</p>

<p>“I have since learned it, sir.”</p>

<p>“I understand that he afterward enlisted
and is now at the front. Is that true?”</p>

<p>“I believe it is.”</p>

<p>“How is it that so unpatriotic a father
can have so patriotic a son?”</p>

<p>“I hold myself to be as much of a patriot,
sir, as any man in this state. The boy and
I take different views of the same matter,
that is all. He is young, barely seventeen,
and easily influenced by professions of
loyalty and the glitter of arms. He has no
business to be in the ranks. His place is
at home with his mother. I am willing, I
desire, to be substituted for him.”</p>

<p>“I see. The scheme is a pretty one, but
we cannot permit you to purchase immunity
from punishment in that way. Neither
your son’s age, nor his patriotism, nor his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
bravery can serve to effect your release.
You have the standing only of a deserter,
you must be dealt with as such. I shall
remand you to the officers of the division
and regiment to which, as a drafted man,
you were assigned. They may shoot you,
or hang you, or do what they will with you.
I am through with you. In my judgment
no power on earth can save you from the
extreme penalty meted out to deserters
unless it be Abraham Lincoln himself.
At any rate, I do not want you longer on
Pennsylvania soil. Remove the prisoner.”</p>

<p>No wonder Rhett Bannister received
little sympathy or consideration at the
hands of his captors after that condemnation.
Between two soldiers under orders
to deliver him to the commander of the
regiment to which he had been assigned,
he was hustled and hurried on board train,
and so off toward Washington.</p>

<p>The soldier guard, at the first opportunity,
purchased a pack of cards and a bottle
of whiskey. At the station where the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
change of cars was made another bottle of
whiskey was obtained. The smoking-car in
which they sat, and up and down the aisle of
which they reeled, was filled with the noise
of their harsh orders, their rude quarreling
with each other, and their coarse jests at
the expense of their prisoner. To Rhett
Bannister it was a bitter, a humiliating, a
degrading night. But long before the train
rolled into the station at Washington, both
drunken soldiers had fallen into a heavy
sleep. Nor did they awaken when the
brakeman announced the station and cried,
“All out!”</p>

<p>The few passengers remaining in the car
rose to leave. Bannister rose with them.
Not so much because he desired to escape
from the custody of the Federal authorities,
as because he wished to relieve himself
of the odious and repellent society of his
drunken and disreputable guards.</p>

<p>One man, looking at him askance, said:—</p>

<p>“He ought not to be allowed to get away
like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>And another one replied:—</p>

<p>“Let him go. After such a night as he
has had he deserves his freedom. But I
hope his guards will be court-martialed and
shot.”</p>

<p>After that no one attempted to detain
him, and Rhett Bannister stepped down
from the car, a free man. He walked leisurely
up the train platform, across the
lobby, through the waiting-room, and out
into the street. Over the roofs of the houses
to the east the sky was beginning to show
the first faint streaks of morning gray. An
all-night restaurant at the corner attracted
his attention, and it occurred to him that
he should be hungry. He knew that he was
very tired. He entered, and the sleepy and
sullen waiter served him with a sandwich
and a cup of coffee. Refreshed, he went
out once more into the street. It was very
quiet in the city at this hour. Only a few
stragglers were abroad and they did not
notice him.</p>

<p>When he reached Pennsylvania Avenue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
he turned up toward the Treasury building
and sauntered slowly on. Not that he cared
particularly which direction he took. But,
in other days, he had been familiar with the
streets of Washington, and some trend of
mind or instinct of memory led his steps
that way. He knew that he could not permanently
escape, that, sooner or later, he
would be recaptured and put to his punishment,
and that his punishment would
be the more hasty and severe because of his
temporary freedom.</p>

<p>The hope that he had dared to entertain
on leaving home, that he might be permitted
to take his son’s place in the ranks,
had now quite vanished. Before him lay
only disgrace and death and a stain on his
family name in the North for generations.
It was the darkest, most desolate hour his
life had known. A small squad of soldiers,
in command of an officer, approached him,
marching up the street through the crisp
morning air in brisk time, swinging their
arms in unison as they came, and the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
entered his mind that the best thing he
could do would be to surrender himself to
them. But when he met them he passed
without speaking, and they paid no attention
to him. A little farther on a crippled
veteran with crutches sat on the curb and
asked alms as Bannister passed by. And
this hater of the Federal blue thrust his
hand into his pocket, drew forth a liberal
sum, and gave it to the uniformed beggar,
without a word. The man was probably a
fraud, but what did it matter? It was doubtless
a doomed man’s last opportunity to
do a charitable deed. So he passed on, up
around the Treasury building and along
the front of the White House. It was almost
daylight now, but the street-lamps had not
yet been extinguished, and in the President’s
mansion two windows were still brilliantly
illuminated.</p>

<p>As Bannister reached the corner by the
War Department building he turned and
looked back at the White House. There
lived the man whom he had ridiculed as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
buffoon, whom he had denounced as a
tyrant, whom he had decried as a malefactor.
And the remark made by Captain
Yohe the day before at Easton came back
into his mind: “No power on earth can
save you from the extreme penalty meted out
to deserters unless it be Abraham Lincoln
himself.”</p>

<p>So this man held also in his hands dominion
over life and death. At his word,
spoken or withheld, he, Rhett Bannister,
would live or die. At his word, spoken or
withheld, soldiers by the thousands had
given and would still give their lives that
his counsels and his judgments might prevail.
What an awful responsibility! How
it must weigh on a man’s soul! How it
must sober him and search him, and drive
from his heart all forms of avarice and
selfishness and hatred and hypocrisy! How
could this man Lincoln, by any human
possibility, be anything but honest and
humble and God-fearing, with such an
awful load upon his mind and heart!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Involuntarily, as he pondered, Bannister
had turned into the park lying between
the White House and the War Department
and was sauntering leisurely up the path.
There was no purpose in it. Doubtless, his
thoughts being upon Abraham Lincoln, he
was drawn unconsciously toward the physical
abiding-place of the man.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, he became aware
that some one was coming toward him
down the walk. In the gray light of the
morning, under the frost-bitten foliage, a
man, tall, bent, with a high black hat on
his head, and a gray plaid shawl thrown
about his shoulders to protect him from
the chill October air, came shuffling down
the path. One glance at the uncouth figure,
at the deep-lined, careworn face, into the
sad and measureless depths of the never-to-be-forgotten
eyes told Bannister that the
man who approached him was Abraham
Lincoln.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">So this was Lincoln—the man whom,
lately, Rhett Bannister had hated
above all other living men, at whose door
he had laid all the woes and wounds and
spilled blood of the nation. Awkward, indeed,
he was, with gnarled features, ungainly
limbs, and shambling gait. All this
Bannister had expected to see. But where
was the domineering air, the crafty expression,
the pride of power, the ingrained
coarseness, for which he had also looked?
In that ungraceful form he could see now
only the human frame bending under the
weight of a mighty responsibility. In the furrowed
face, drawn and ashy, and eloquent
with suffering and care, in the deep-set,
patient eyes, signals of a soul weighed down
with sorrow, he could read now only the
story of a life untouched by selfishness, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
a heart breaking with the burdens and
pierced with the griefs of a mighty and
beloved nation.</p>

<p>And with the vision of this man before
him, so intensely human, so pleadingly
simple, Rhett Bannister felt slipping away
from him the old hate and scorn and
enmity, and into their places came creeping
pity for the man, reverence for his sorrow,
sympathy with him in the awful burden
he was bearing on his bent shoulders
and in his mighty heart, the problems,
griefs, and cares of his brothers, North and
South, engaged in fratricidal strife. It was
all in a moment. It followed one look into
that infinitely sad and tender face, but in
that moment the tide of feeling in Rhett
Bannister’s mind and heart had turned.
Abraham Lincoln was no longer the hated
monster of other days, but a man, instead,
of like passions, cares, griefs, and hopes
with himself; a man to whom it was no
humiliation to speak; nay, a man to whom
he would dare to appeal in behalf of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
son and himself, assured in advance of an
honest and sympathetic hearing.</p>

<p>And what was it that Captain Yohe had
said?</p>

<p>Bannister uncovered his head, and moved
to the side of the path to let the Chief
Magistrate by. And, even as he did so,
there arose in his heart, and issued from
his lips, an appeal which, one week before,
he would have scorned to make.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” he said, “this meeting
is by chance, but I beg that you will grant
me one moment to hear my case.”</p>

<p>The President stopped and cast a look
of sad inquiry on the man who had accosted
him. Doubtless, he thought, here was another
father come to plead for the life of a
son who had been sentenced to a disgraceful
death. For what offense this time?
Cowardice, desertion, sleeping at his post,
or some other crime for which stern war
demands stern penalties? They were so
common in those days, appeals from fathers,
mothers, wives, sweethearts; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the tender heart of Lincoln was daily pierced
with them.</p>

<p>“Well?” He braced himself mentally,
to listen to some new and agonizing tale of
trouble.</p>

<p>“I will be frank with you, Mr. President,”
Bannister hurried on, “and brief. I am a
Pennsylvanian. I am what is called a copperhead.
A few weeks ago I was drafted.
I refused to report for service. I have an
only son, just passed seventeen, who is as
ardent a supporter of the Union cause as I
am a detractor of it. Without my knowledge
he visited the provost-marshal of the district
and asked to go as a substitute in my
place. His request being denied, he enlisted.
That was four days ago. He is now in
Meade’s army in Virginia. Yesterday I left
my home, hoping to reach him where he
is and induce the officer of his regiment to
discharge him and take me in his place.
Before I was twenty miles on my journey I
was arrested as a deserter. The provost-marshal
sent me for condemnation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
sentence to the regiment to which, as a
drafted man, I had been assigned. Less
than an hour ago I reached Washington.
My guards were drunk and asleep. I
walked away from them and came here.
It is by the merest chance that I now meet
you. My boy is too young to withstand the
rigors and hardships of the service. He
should be back home with his mother. I
want to take his place in the ranks. Mr.
President, I cannot hope to do this unless
you will help me.”</p>

<p>For a moment the President stood, looking
into the eyes of the speaker. Here was
a new and novel case. It aroused his interest.
It appealed to his humanity.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said, “let’s go over to the
telegraph office. It’s too cold to stand here.
I was going there anyway. It’s all right,”
he added to two guards who had hurried
up. “I want to talk to this man. He’s going
over to the telegraph office with me.”</p>

<p>So the lank, angular, shawl-clad figure
moved on down the path, followed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
escaped conscript, while he in turn was
followed by the two guards, who watched
his every movement. A suspicion entered
Bannister’s mind as he walked, that the
President was leading him into ambush
to procure the more easily his re-arrest.
The re-arrest did not much matter. But
that any one, after looking into this man’s
face, should think of charging him with
duplicity, that did matter. And the next
moment the suspicion was effectually cast
out.</p>

<p>They went up the steps leading to the
War Department, and into the telegraph
office which was installed there. Lincoln
asked for dispatches left for him by Major
Eckert, and read them over carefully.
Some of them he read twice. The inactivity
of the Army of the Potomac, the apparent
inability of Meade to strike a telling,
if not a final blow, weighed heavily on his
mind. He had come over, as was his custom,
in the early morning, to get and read,
at first-hand, dispatches from the front.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
When he finally laid down the yellow slips
he beckoned to Bannister to follow him.</p>

<p>“We’ll go into Stanton’s room,” he said;
“he won’t be here for an hour yet.”</p>

<p>So they sat down together in the room
ordinarily occupied by the Secretary of
War. In the outer office the telegraph instruments
kept up a monotonous clicking.
Through the open door between the rooms
messengers could be seen passing hurriedly
in and out. Lincoln stretched his long legs
out in front of him and ran his fingers
through his carelessly combed hair.</p>

<p>“So you got away from your guards,
did you?” he inquired. “Did you say they
were drunk?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. President, very drunk. They
procured whiskey and drank a great deal
on the train coming down to Washington.
When I left the car this morning they were
sound asleep.”</p>

<p>“What are their names? To what command
are they attached?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. My name is Rhett Bannister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and my home is at Mount Hermon
in Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>The President rose, went out into the
telegraph office, and dictated a message.
When he returned and sat down again he
said:—</p>

<p>“I’ve sent out orders to have those men
hunted up, arrested, and remanded for
trial. The soldier on duty who shows
cowardice in the face of the enemy may
have some excuse for his conduct. But the
soldier on duty who shows cowardice in the
face of John Barleycorn must reap the full
reward of his cowardice.”</p>

<p>He set his lips tightly together, and let
his clenched hand fall on the table-top.
After a moment he continued:—</p>

<p>“So you are what they call up in Pennsylvania
a copperhead?”</p>

<p>“I have been so designated, Mr. President.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, now, I’ve been wanting to
see some of you copperheads and talk with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
you, and find out from you, if I can, why
you oppose the war, and seek opportunities
to stab the administration in the back. I’ve
been wanting to know. Maybe this meeting
is providential. Maybe I can learn something
from you that will help us all. I’ve
never run across one of you before, face to
face, like this. Vallandigham’s the only one
I know much about, and he’s so fiery and
oratorical I can’t quite get head or tail to
what he says. What is your creed, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I can speak for myself only, Mr. President.
I am of Southern birth and breeding.
My sympathies lie entirely with the South.
I feel that they were right on every issue
between them and the abolitionists and
radicals of the North. I feel that they had
just cause to secede from the compact
formed by the states, and to set up a government
of their own which should be in accord
with their views and policies. I feel that
the attempt to coerce them was unjust and
tyrannical. I feel that the war, on the part
of the North, has been and is an awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
mistake, criminal in many of its aspects.
Feeling that way, I have done all that lay
in my power, from my home in the North,
openly, and I believe honorably, to oppose
the war, and to weaken the power of your
administration. I speak frankly because
you have asked me for my views.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; that’s right. That’s
what I want to know. We must be honest
with each other. Now, don’t you think the
Union, as it was, was a splendid aggregation
of states?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Lincoln, I do.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you think the Union, restored
as it was, would be a still more splendid
aggregation of states?”</p>

<p>“I do, if the causes of war were removed.”</p>

<p>“Exactly! We are trying to remove
them. You and your friends of the South
are trying to retain them. If their armies
prevail in this struggle, the situation is hopeless.
Nothing is settled. The Union is
shattered. The future is black with trouble.
If our armies prevail in this struggle, all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
issues that led to the war become dead
issues. The Union will be restored as it
was. The future will be large with promise.
I can see, so far as my vision reaches,
but one end that will bring permanent
peace and happiness. We must conquer
the armies of the South; we <em>must</em> do it.
The life of the Union, for which our fathers
fought, depends on it. There, I’ve said a
good deal. I don’t know that I’ve made myself
clear. I don’t get a chance to talk to
you copperheads very often. I take it when
I can get it.”</p>

<p>There was nothing flippant or sarcastic
in his tone or manner. He was frank and
plain, but in deadly earnest. It required
no brilliancy of comprehension to discover
that. Rhett Bannister saw it and acknowledged
it. He saw more. He saw that this
man grasped the situation as no man had
ever grasped it before. That in his heart
the Union was the one thing of prime importance,
and that his mind and soul and
body were tense with the desire and effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to save the Union. But was he right?
Was he right? For, while Bannister could
not now but acknowledge the sincerity and
skill of the man who was talking to him, he
was not yet ready to yield his own judgment.</p>

<p>“I do not think you put yourself in the
place of the men of the South,” he replied,
“and look at the matter through their eyes.
Consider for a moment. You deny them
the right to live in new territory of the
United States in the same manner in which
they and their fathers, for generations back,
have lived in their Southern homes. Is
that just? They resent that as an indignity.
You seek to compel them by force of arms
to accept this humiliating situation. They
resist. Why should they not? Finally, you
yourself issue a proclamation depriving
them, so far as lies in your power, of their
right to own slaves. Then you demand that
they lay down their arms in order to save
the Union. Do you think they can greatly

<p>“My friend,” he said, “you look at but
one aspect of the case. I believe I view it
as a whole. You are sincere in your belief.
I concede that. The great body of your
brethren in the South are sincere. We are
both fighting for what we believe to be the
right. We both pray to the same God for
the success of our armies. We could not
do that if we were not honest with ourselves.
But I believe I have the larger vision. I
believe I see more clearly what will bring
about the largest measure of prosperity
for all of us. I believe in the Union as it
was. I want to preserve it. I want to bring
back into it all those states, all those citizens
who are willfully and mistakenly trying to
leave it, and to destroy it. All that I have
done, I have done with that end in view. All
that I shall do, I shall do with that end in
view. If I have proclaimed emancipation for
the slaves, that was the purpose of it. If we
must prosecute this war until their last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
soldier, or ours, is lying dead on the battle-field,
that will be the purpose of it. I have
declared amnesty to every man in rebellion,
save the leaders of the insurrection, who
will come back to us and take the oath of
allegiance. The purpose of the declaration
is to save, to restore, to build up, to
make bigger and better and stronger the
Union which has been and ought to be
more to us and dearer to us than any man
or body of men that the nation can produce.
That is my one mission, my one purpose,
my one hope, and, under God, my one determination
to the end.”</p>

<p>Into the gaunt, haggard, ashen face
came, as he talked, the light of the high
purpose that filled his soul. To Rhett Bannister,
looking on him, listening in breathless
suspense, it seemed almost as though,
like the angel at the sepulchre, “his countenance
was like lightning, and his raiment
white as snow.” The mighty and homely
spirit that had dominated great minds in
this tremendous conflict, and bent them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to its will, had already laid its spell on the
mind of this one-time hater of the nation’s
chief. Abraham Lincoln stood revealed
before him now, not as the ambitious tyrant,
the crafty plotter, the traitor to his
kind, but as the one man of greatest
skill, of wisest thought, of tenderest heart,
of largest soul, whom the troublous times
had brought forth.</p>

<p>In the silence that followed Lincoln’s
words, as Bannister sat mute and thrilled,
he felt that every heart-beat in his breast was
hammering down the last barrier that stood
between him and the personality of the
great President. Henceforth, no matter how
divergent their views, their logic, their ways
to conclusions, in the essence of a large
patriotism and a great humanity their souls
had touched, and they were one.</p>

<p>At length Bannister spoke. It was his
last word, his final protest, his weak clutch
at the floating, fading straw.</p>

<p>“But the pride of the South, Mr. President;
the pride of the South!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Lincoln sat back and crossed his legs, and
over his face there came a reminiscent smile.</p>

<p>“Up in Sangamon County,” he said,
“when I lived there, I knew a man by the
name of Seth Mills. He owned a spring
in common with his neighbor Sam Lewis.
But they couldn’t agree on the amount of
water each should have, nor how much
could be carried away by trough; and their
quarrel over the spring led to a fight and
a lawsuit. Well, when I went up to Springfield,
the controversy was still on, but Seth
was getting a good bit the worst of it. One
day he came up to Springfield to see me,
and when he came into my office I said to
myself: ‘The spring war has reached an
acute stage.’ But Seth sat down and said:
‘Abe, I’ve decided to be generous to Sam.
He’s licked me in the courts of Sangamon
County, but I <em>could</em> take the case up to the
Supreme Court of the United States and
make him a lot o’ trouble and cost. But I
ain’t goin’ to do it. I’m goin’ to swaller
my pride an’ be liberal with him. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
I’ve proposed to Sam that he chip in an’
we’ll build the spring bigger an’ deeper,
an’ wall it up, an’ put in a pipe big enough
to run water to both our houses. It’ll cost
two or three dollars, but I believe it’s wuth
it. An’ Sam has yielded the p’int and accepted
the offer.’”</p>

<p>Lincoln laughed softly and then continued:—</p>

<p>“It seems to me, my friend, that the
South can afford to do as Seth Mills did,
swallow her pride, be generous to us, get
back with us into the Union, and help us
build it bigger and broader and deeper,
and wall it up, and put in a pipe big enough
to supply us all with prosperity and happiness
and peace. Maybe it’ll cost two or
three dollars, but I believe it’s worth it.”</p>

<p>It was not until the story and its moral
were nearly finished that Bannister realized
that it was about his own old Seth Mills
that the President was talking.</p>

<p>“I know that man, Mr. Lincoln,” he
said. “I know Seth Mills, and I can well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
believe and appreciate the story. He has
been, for years, my next and most valued
neighbor, a good citizen, an honest man,
and a worshiper at the shrine of Abraham
Lincoln.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, I’m glad to hear from Seth;
I’m glad to hear from him. I knew he went
East somewhere. You tell him, when you
see him, if you ever do, that Abe Lincoln
sends him greeting and good wishes in memory
of the old days in Sangamon County.”</p>

<p>Then the light of reminiscent memory
died out from the President’s face, and the
old strained, haggard, weary look came
back into it. He straightened up his long
body and said:—</p>

<p>“Let’s see. You’re a fugitive, ain’t you?
a deserter?”</p>

<p>“Something like that, I believe, Mr.
Lincoln.”</p>

<p>The President rose and went out into the
telegraph office and gave some orders.
When he came back he said:—</p>

<p>“I’ve sent for Lieutenant Forsythe. I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
turn you over to him. He’ll see that you
get to the right place. Tell me again about
that boy of yours, will you?”</p>

<p>So Bannister again told Bob’s story, and
again expressed his willingness and eagerness
to take the boy’s place in the ranks.</p>

<p>“I do not feel quite as I did when I
came in here, Mr. Lincoln,” he said. “I
am ready now to concede that the quickest
way to permanent peace is by the subjugation
of the Southern armies. But, Mr.
President, when the South is beaten, I am
sure—I am sure you will be charitable.”</p>

<p>The President did not reply. He had
turned to the table, taken a pen, and begun
to write. When he had finished he again
faced Bannister, and read to him what he
had written. It was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">War Department, Washington, D. C.</span>,<br />
<span class="r3"><i>October 26, 1863</i>.</span></p>

<p class="noi">“<span class="smcap">Major-General Meade</span>,<br />
<span class="l3">Army of Potomac:—</span></p>

<p>“This letter will be given to you by
Lieut. J. B. Forsythe, who has in custody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and will turn over to you one Rhett Bannister
of Pennsylvania. Bannister was drafted,
failed to respond, and was apprehended
by the provost-guard. On his way to join
the regiment to which he had been assigned
he accidentally ran across me. It appears
that he has a son, not yet eighteen years
of age, who recently enlisted, without his
father’s knowledge, and is now in your
army, Col. Gordon’s regiment of Penn.
Volunteers, Co. M. Bannister wants to
take his son’s place, and have the boy discharged
and sent home to his mother,
who is back there alone. I can see no objection,
if it would not be subversive of discipline
in your army, to discharging the
boy and taking the father in his place. If
this meets with your views I would like
it done.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">A. Lincoln.</span>”<br /></p>
</div>

<p>He folded the letter, handed it to Bannister,
and said:—</p>

<p>“There, you can give that to Forsythe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
when he comes, and he’ll take you to Meade;
and whatever Meade says must be done
must be done. Maybe he’ll take you and
discharge the boy. Maybe he’ll keep you
both. Maybe he’ll keep the boy and have
you court-martialed and shot. Whatever
he does you’ll have to be satisfied with it.
Well, I guess that’s all.”</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, took his well-worn,
high, black hat from the table, and reached
out his hand to Bannister, who gripped it,
unable for a moment to speak. When his
voice did come to him he could only say:—</p>

<p>“Mr. President, I am deeply grateful to
you. I came here distrusting and disliking
you. I shall leave here—well—I—from
to-day I am a Lincoln conscript.”</p>

<p>In the telegraph office the President
stopped for a few moments to look over
late dispatches, and then went out, back
through the park and across the lawn, to
the treadmill of the White House, there to
wear his own life out that the nation which
he loved might live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>While Bannister was waiting for his
guard, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton,
stern, spectacled, heavy-bearded, came
bustling in.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said as he espied Bannister
in his room, “what is it? What do you
want?”</p>

<p>“I am waiting for Lieutenant Forsythe,”
replied Bannister, who at once recognized
the great War Secretary. “Mr. Lincoln
has given me this order.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he handed the letter to the
Secretary, who took it and read it carefully
through.</p>

<p>“Another one of the President’s interferences!”
he exclaimed impatiently. “He
has enough to do at the White House. I
wish he would let this department alone.
His orders for suspension of sentence, and
honorable discharge, and all that, in defiance
of the regulations, are absolutely
subversive of discipline. They are demoralizing
the entire army.”</p>

<p>A young officer had entered while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
testy Secretary was voicing his annoyance,
and now stood at attention in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Here’s another order of the President’s,”
continued the Secretary, addressing the
officer. “He wants you to take this man
down to Meade. I don’t know anything
about the case. It ought to have gone
through this department. I suppose I’ll
have to back it.”</p>

<p>He sat down at the table, endorsed the
letter on the back, and handed it to the
officer, who took it and read it carefully.</p>

<p>“Why is it,” continued Stanton, still
voicing his irritability, “that the President
always chooses you to send on these irregular
errands?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Mr. Secretary,” replied
the lieutenant, “except that Mr. Lincoln
and I trust each other.”</p>

<p>The great War Secretary looked at the
officer for a moment, with a quizzical expression
in his eyes, then, without another
word, he turned to his desk and took up
again the herculean task which as a patriot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
as an enthusiast, as a lover though a critic
of Lincoln, he cheerfully and splendidly
performed.</p>

<p>So Bannister, accompanied by his
guard, went out, along the street, across the
Potomac, and down through war-ravaged
Virginia, toward the camping hosts of
Meade, toward the son who, with a foresight
clearer than his own, had preceded
him to war. And as he went a new fire of
patriotism burned in his heart, a new light
of comprehension illumined his mind, and
to his list of the world’s great heroes was
added a new great name.</p>

<p class="cap">For three days, Robert Barnwell Bannister
had been a soldier of the United
States. On the evening of the third day
he sat at the opening of his tent studying
a small volume of infantry tactics which
had fallen into his hands. Inside the tent
his comrade and tent-mate, a young fellow
hardly older and no less patriotic and
enthusiastic than himself, just in from two
hours of picket-duty, lay resting on a rude
board couch, with a block of wood and a
coat for a pillow, singing softly to himself
a rude bit of doggerel that had recently
become popular in camp.</p>

</div></div>

<p>After a moment he called out:—</p>

<p>“Say, Bob, here’s a conundrum. What’s
the difference between a bounty-jumper
and a—”</p>

<p>“Oh, button up!” replied Bob, who was
studying out a peculiarly difficult infantry
formation, and did not wish to be interrupted.</p>

<p>“All right! now you’ll never know,” responded
his comrade.</p>

<p>For a few moments there was silence,
then the voice in the tent was again heard
singing rude rhymes of war.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“We are goin’ to drop our thunder,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Above the tent, below it, all about it,
from Warrenton to Turkey Run, was encamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Meade’s great army. There were
seasoned veterans, raw volunteers, conscript
regiments, all accepting and enduring
with philosophic fortitude the hardships
and vicissitudes of army life. Here
and there camp-fires had been lighted,
here and there a belated meal was being
eaten. It was an hour for rest and relaxation
from the stern duties of war, only the
picket force being thrown to the front in
triplicate lines, to protect the army from
surprise.</p>

<p>Bob Bannister looked well in his suit of
army blue. He bore himself with soldier-like
precision, and a dignity befitting his
occupation. Young, enthusiastic, good-natured,
intensely patriotic, he had at once
become a favorite with the men of his company.
His every duty, performed with intelligence
and alacrity, marked him in the
eyes of the officers as one destined to promotion.
As he sat there in the twilight,
still studying his book, an orderly approached
him and inquired:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you private Bannister?”</p>

<p>“That is my name.”</p>

<p>“You are wanted at company headquarters.”</p>

<p>Wondering what it could mean, private
Bannister laid aside his book and went
with the orderly up the company street to
the captain’s quarters. Inside the tent a
candle was burning on a rude table by
which the captain was seated. Standing
about, against the inner walls, were a half-dozen
men whose faces the boy could not
recognize in the semi-darkness.</p>

<p>Bob advanced to within a few paces of
the table, saluted, and stood at attention.</p>

<p>“Private Bannister,” said the captain,
“I want to know if you recognize this
person?”</p>

<p>He nodded, as he spoke, toward a man
dressed in civilian costume, standing near
the entrance to the tent. Bob turned and
peered into the shadows. The man stepped
forward.</p>

<p>“Father!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rob!”</p>

<p>And then Bob rushed into his father’s
arms.</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke. But the
soldiers who saw the meeting never forgot
it.</p>

<p><a href="#image07">“Father, what does it mean?”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 472px;">
<a id="image07">
  <img src="images/image07.jpg" width="472" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_219">“FATHER, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?”</a></div>
</div>

<p>Bannister, his voice lost in emotion and
his eyes dim with tears, pointed to a paper
lying on the captain’s table. He had tried
to imagine how Bob would look in uniform,
but he had not thought to see quite so
straight, manly a figure, clear of eye, handsome
of countenance, “every inch a soldier.”
And the words of Mary Bannister,
when he read Bob’s letter to her, came back
into his mind and voiced his sentiment:
“I’m proud of him. He’s the bravest boy
in the world.”</p>

<p>“Private Bannister,” said the captain,
“your father is here in custody of Lieutenant
Forsythe of the regular army, who
brings with him this letter.”</p>

<p>The captain then read impressively, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
a sense of its true importance, the President’s
letter to General Meade. When
he reached the end and read the name “A.
Lincoln,” every man in the tent lifted his
cap reverently from his head.</p>

<p>“This communication,” continued the
captain, “was delivered to the general
commanding, by him endorsed and delivered
to the division commander, then to
the commander of our brigade, to the
colonel of the regiment, and in due course
has reached me. It has been endorsed as
follows by all the officers through whose
hands it has passed: ‘If not prejudicial to
the service, let the President’s wish be carried
out.’ There is therefore nothing left
for me to do except to give the order for
your discharge, and the mustering in of
your father to take your place. Permit me
to add, however, that we shall regret to
lose you. During your brief term of service
you have been a good soldier, a credit to
the company and the army.”</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
half rose from the table as if to close the
interview. Then Bob found his voice.</p>

<p>“But, Captain Howarth,” he said, “I
don’t want to be discharged. I don’t want
to go home. I want to stay. I am old
enough. I can march. I can do picket-duty.
I can fight. But I can’t go back home
now, it’s simply impossible.”</p>

<p>The captain dropped back into his seat,
incredulous. Among the men standing
against the tent-wall there was a buzz of
approving voices. Rhett Bannister put his
arm about the boy’s shoulders affectionately.</p>

<p>“You’re right, my son,” he said. “You’re
right. I shouldn’t have asked it. I didn’t
think. I didn’t realize; but—you’re
right.”</p>

<p>Then Lieutenant Forsythe stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Permit me,” he said, “to make a suggestion.
I talked much with this man on
my way down here. I believe he will make
a good and earnest soldier. The son has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
already proved his ability and patriotism.
Why not keep them both? I am sure it
will not militate against the spirit of the
President’s order.”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” exclaimed Sergeant
Anderson, stepping out from the shadow
where he had stood dreading lest he should
lose his protégé, of whom he had grown
wondrously fond.</p>

<p>“Good!” said the other men.</p>

<p>“Let it be done,” responded the captain.
And it was done.</p>

<p>In less than two hours Rhett Bannister
was also a soldier of the United States.
And so he and his son served their country
in the ranks. They ate by the same camp-fire,
slept in the same rude tent, and
marched, shoulder to shoulder, through the
autumn mists and the winter slush and
mud of old Virginia. At Mine Run, a
month after they were sworn in, they had
their first baptism of fire, and bore themselves
with such coolness and bravery as
to elicit compliments for both from Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Howarth. In winter-quarters, with the
monotony of camp-life and the round of
daily duties pressing on them, their spirits
never flagged. Both by precept and example
they radiated courage and cheerfulness
to all their company. When, occasionally,
a spirit of dissatisfaction showed
itself in the ranks, when impatience with
those in command became manifest, when
poor and scanty fare and wretched clothing
were the rule, it was Rhett Bannister, cool
and logical, free of speech and earnest in
manner, who moved among the men and
counseled patience, who pointed out to
them their duty and appealed to their patriotism,
and never without success. “His
influence with the soldiers,” said Captain
Howarth, one day, “is worth a thousand
courts-martial.”</p>

<p>There was one time in particular when
murmurings of discontent broke forth,
when the winter rains of Virginia were
coldest and most piercing; when food was
scarce and foraging forbidden; when Meade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
under whom the soldiers had fought at
Gettysburg, was discredited and displaced,
and Grant, whom they did not know, was
given supreme command; when the authorities
at Washington seemed stricken with
lethargy and blindness, and the anti-war
sentiment in the North, increasing with
dangerous rapidity, came filtering down
to ears and hearts in the ranks not unwilling
to receive it. Then it was that Rhett
Bannister, the one-time hater of the administration,
detractor of the army, denouncer
of the war, went out among his
comrades, from man to man, from tent to
tent, from company to company, urging
duty, pleading patriotism, counseling patience.</p>

<p>“You think you have troubles,” he said
one night to a group of murmuring men,
crowded into a smoky tent, while the cold
rain dripped through the tattered canvas,
and the wind howled dismally among the
pines outside. “You think you have hardships
and burdens and afflictions in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
service of your country. Let me tell you
something. I have seen Abraham Lincoln.
I have talked with him face to face. I have
read in his sad eyes and hollow cheeks, and
the lines creasing his forehead, the story
of his suffering. Boys, that man is bearing
the burdens of this country and the woes of
her people on his heart. Every drop of
blood that is shed is as though it came from
his body, every groan of a wounded soldier
is as though it came from his lips, every
tear from the eyes of those left desolate is
as though it furrowed his face. You cannot
conceive the immensity of the burdens
he is bearing, or the weight of suffering
he endures. Yet he is patiently, faithfully,
earnestly, prayerfully, with tremendous
power of will and strength of soul, pressing
on toward the hoped-for end, and by
God’s grace he is going soon to bring us all
back out of the shadows of war into the
light of a victorious peace. Boys, when you
think you have burdens to bear, remember
Abraham Lincoln.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>And they did. No man who heard those
impassioned words that night ever again
opened his lips in complaint of his commanders.</p>

<p>Letters came from Mount Hermon almost
daily, sometimes a half-dozen in a bunch.
People up there wanted Rhett Bannister
and his son to know that they were appreciated
at home. But the letters that came
from Mary Bannister, strong, cheerful,
splendid letters, were the ones that brought
most joy to the hearts of their recipients.
At last she felt that the ban had been
lifted, and that she was once more a woman
among women. She was not insensible,
indeed, to the dangers that surrounded
her loved ones night and day. She
knew well enough that any mail might
bring her terrible tidings about one or both
of them. But such anxiety was as nothing
to the agony of mind she had endured
through many weeks before her son and
husband went down to the war. And as
there drifted up to her ears now and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
news of the brave conduct and manly bearing
of those so near and dear to her, she
went about her household labors, happy
in the thought that from this time forth
she could look any man or woman in the
face and say: “Behold my heroes!”</p>

<p>One day there came down to Rhett Bannister
a letter from Sarah Jane Stark. A
wise, impetuous, laudatory letter, such as
no one on earth could write save Sarah Jane
Stark herself. Over the first two pages
Bannister laughed like a boy, but when he
had finished the last line of the letter, tears
were streaming down his face.</p>

<p>“To think,” she wrote, “that the one-time
copperhead of Mount Hermon is serving
his country in the ranks. I would give
Billy my cat to see you in your blue uniform,
and you know how much I love Billy.
And that dear boy! I never cried about a
boy in my life before, you know that; but
I cry about that boy of yours every time I
hear from him! I’m so proud of him, and
so fond of him! Heaven bless both of you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>And down at the end of the letter a postscript
was hidden away. It said:—</p>

<p>“I’ve induced Mary Bannister to come
up to town with Louise and live with me
this winter. It’ll be pretty lonely down at
your place, and I’ve got a big house and
plenty of room, and I want company, and
I want her. She’s such a dear, brave,
patient little woman, and we’ll have a
glorious time together.”</p>

<p>So, with no disquietude on account of their
loved ones at home on their minds, Rhett
Bannister and his son faced the enemy and,
with their comrades in arms, fared on.</p>

<p>When Grant, in the spring of ’64, began
his arduous and bloody campaign from
the Rappahannock to the Rapidan and
from the Rapidan to the James, they were
in the forefront of the conflict. Yet they
seemed to lead charmed lives. Out from
the tangled depths and thousand pitfalls
of The Wilderness, from the forest scarred
and seamed across with fire and shell and
bullet, from the ghastly field with its blood-soaked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
herbage and its piled-up heaps of
dead, they came unscathed. At Spottsylvania
Court-House and up and down and
across the North Anna, through all of May
they marched and fought. At Cold Harbor,
in the early days of June, they faced, with
their comrades, the merciless fire of those
Confederate riflemen, until, scorched, winnowed,
withered, the Union army, with ten
thousand dead and wounded on the field,
retired from the hopeless and unequal contest.
Yet father and son came out of it
without serious injury. Shocked, sickened,
exhausted, they were indeed; scratched
here and there by hissing bullets, but otherwise
unharmed. Again, in the awful fiasco
before Petersburg, in the crater left by the
exploding mine, hemmed in, helpless, horribly
entangled, black soldiers and white
falling by hundreds under the pitiless enfilading
fire of a thousand down-pointed
Confederate guns, even from that pit of
death they escaped, wrenched, bruised,
battered, buffeted, but whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>So, through all that summer they fought,
in the bloodiest, cruelest campaign recorded
in history, shallow trenches filled
with dead everywhere proclaiming the awful
sacrifice at which Grant was forcing the
desperate and depleted armies of the South
into their final strongholds.</p>

<p>As his officers had predicted from the beginning,
Bob Bannister was rapidly promoted.
For meritorious conduct, for brave
deeds, to fill vacancies above him as the
grim tragedy of war played itself out, he
donned his corporal’s stripes, exchanged
them for a sergeant’s, added the orderly’s
diamond, and finally, in the fall of ’64, his
shoulders were decorated with the straps of
a first lieutenant. When this happened his
company held a jubilee. He was a mere boy,
indeed, not long past eighteen, possibly the
youngest commissioned officer in the Army
of the Potomac; but the men of his command
trusted him, believed in him, loved
him, and would have followed him wherever
he chose to lead, even to the gates of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>But Rhett Bannister was not promoted.
That was not, however, the fault of his
officers. Nor was it that his conduct was
not splendidly soldier-like and meritorious,—it
was simply because he would not have
it so. It was after Cold Harbor that Captain
Baker called him one night to company
headquarters,—Howarth had long
ago been invalided home,—and said to
him:—</p>

<p>“Bannister, I am going to make a sergeant
of you.”</p>

<p>“But, captain—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know how you feel, but there’s
no help for it. Brady’s dead, Holbert’s a
prisoner, and Powelton and Gray can’t do
the work. You must take it.”</p>

<p>“Captain, I beg of you not to do it. Be
good to me. I’ll fight anywhere. I’ll take
any mission. I’ll face any danger. But I
can’t accept an office in the army of the
United States. I told you this when you
spoke of making me a corporal. I repeat
it now. If I were to accept this honor I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
never could fight again, I never could look
the boys in the face again, I would feel so
cowardly and ashamed and dismayed.
Don’t do it, captain, I beseech you, don’t
do it! Let me fight in the ranks and be
contented and happy as I am to-night.”</p>

<p>And the captain gave heed to his protest,
knowing that it came from his heart;
and so he continued to fight in the ranks,
honored, trusted, and loved by all his comrades.
In the midst of the political campaign
of ’64, when the contest for the office
of President of the United States was stirring
the North as no political contest had
ever stirred it before; when Lincoln’s enemies
felt that they had won the victory, and
that the battle of the ballots on election day
would only ratify it; when Lincoln himself
gave up the hope that he would be permitted
to lead the nation back to peace and
safety; when only the votes of the soldiers
in the field could by any possibility save
the day, Rhett Bannister turned politician
and went out electioneering. From man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
man he went, from company to company,
from regiment to regiment, earnest, anxious,
persuasive, pleading with his whole heart
and soul the cause of Abraham Lincoln.
And when the November ballots were
counted, and the overwhelming majority
proved that the people in the North as well
as the soldiers in the field had confidence
in the great War President, no heart in the
Army of the Potomac beat with more exultant
pride and unbounded happiness
than did the heart of Rhett Bannister, the
Lincoln conscript.</p>

<p>In March came the President’s second
inaugural address. A newspaper containing
a report of it floated early into camp and
came into Bannister’s hands. He read the
address word by word, sentence by sentence
again and again. Then he called together
the men who were fond of listening to him
and read it to them.</p>

<p>“You will not find,” he said, “in all history,
nor in all literature, a clause so sublime
in thought, so simple in diction, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
sweet with divine charity as this; listen:
‘With malice toward none, with charity for
all, with firmness in the right as God gives
us to see the right, let us strive to finish
the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s
wounds; to care for him who shall have
borne the battle, and for his widow and
his orphan; to do all which may achieve and
cherish a just and lasting peace among
ourselves and with all nations.’</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, that is Abraham Lincoln,
than whom no man who ever lived in America
has had a higher aim, a sweeter spirit,
or a more prophetic vision.”</p>

<p>All winter Grant had sat before Petersburg,
grim, silent, relentless, pushing here
and there ever a little farther to the front,
seeking the exhaustion of his enemy, waiting
for the auspicious moment to let fall the
blow which should lead quickly to the inevitable
end. To Lee’s army looking from
the heights on the tented foe in front of
them by day, on the thousand camp-fires
gleaming there at night, it seemed as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
a ravenous monster, white-toothed, fiery-eyed,
lay crouching before them, stretching
out a sharp claw now and then, waiting
pitilessly until the exhausted foe, weak and
helpless, should fall, an easy prey, into its
clutches. Surely no soldier, no army, ever
held out more bravely against more fearful
odds, in more desperate straits, than did
this remnant of Lee’s tattered host, in its
final effort to save the Confederate capital
from falling into the hands of its enemies.
Yet every drum-beat trembling on the soft
spring air was but the knell of Richmond’s
hope; every passing hour brought nearer
and nearer her unavoidable doom.</p>

<p>Late in March Grant threw out a force on
his left, under Sheridan, to meet and turn,
and crush if possible, Lee’s right flank, and
thus precipitate the fall of Petersburg.
It was at Five Forks that the two armies
met and clashed in the last decisive battle
of the war. Overwhelmed in front, cut off
from the main column on the left, borne
down upon from the rear, fighting twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
its numbers on every side, the little army
of Confederate veterans, with a thousand
of its men already captured, and a thousand
lying dead and wounded along the
barricades it had so stoutly defended, broke
and fled helplessly and hopelessly to the
west, only the darkness of night saving it
from utter annihilation at the hands of
Sheridan’s pursuing cavalry.</p>

<p>But on that field of Five Forks, after the
blue-clad hosts had swept over it across
the enemy’s redoubts, and only the grim
harvest of battle was left, dread rows of
fallen men and horses struggling and
groaning among the silent dead, Rhett
Bannister lay, at the edge of the White Oak
road, his shoulder pierced by a minié ball,
his dim eyes seeking vainly for the child
of his heart. And just beyond lay Bob,
stretched on the greensward, his blood-splashed
face turned upward to the twilight
sky, seeing nothing, knowing nothing
of battle or victory, of friend or foe, deaf
alike to the dying thunders of the conflict,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
to the exultant shouts of the victors, to the
heart-stirring cry of that father who would
joyously have given his own life that his
son might live.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE GREAT TRAGEDY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">But Bob Bannister was not killed at
Five Forks, nor did he die of his
wounds. A fragment of a bursting shell had
struck his head, torn loose the scalp, laid
bare the skull, felled him with a crash, and
left him insensible for hours. He did not
know when he was carried from the field;
but, later on, he realized that he was being
jolted over rough roads, that somewhere
there was a great pain of which he was
dimly conscious, and that now and then a
cup of water was placed most refreshingly
to his parched lips. When he did come
fully to himself it was the day after the
battle, and he was in the army hospital at
City Point, one of the hundreds of occupants
of the long rows of cots that lined the
walls. His head was swathed in bandages,
a blinding pain shot back and forth across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
his eyes, and in his mouth was still that insatiable
thirst. On the cot beside him lay
his father, who had also been ordered by the
field surgeon to the hospital at City Point.
Those minié balls made ugly wounds, as
thousands of veterans of both armies can
testify, and Rhett Bannister certainly needed
surgical skill and careful nursing. But the
surgeon who sent him to City Point, and
who knew and loved both him and his son,
had a deeper thought in mind. That wound
of Bob’s, under certain conditions, might
suddenly lead to something very grave, and—well,
it was a good idea for the boy to
have his father at his side. But, for stalwart
manhood and clean and vigorous
youth, wounds yield readily to proper treatment,
and, before many days had passed,
both father and son were well on the road
to recovery.</p>

<p>Then, one morning, a strange thing happened,
and, to Bob Bannister, as he thought
of it in after years, the most beautiful thing
that ever entered into his life. Into the far,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
south door of the hospital tent, accompanied
only by a member of his staff and an
assistant surgeon, came Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>A whisper ran down the rows of cots
that the President was there, and every
man who could do so, rose to his feet, or
sat up in bed, and saluted as “Father
Abraham” passed by. At many a cot he
stopped to give greeting to maimed and
helpless veterans of the war, to speak words
of encouragement to the sick and wounded
boys who had fought and suffered that the
common cause might triumph, to bend over
the prostrate form of some poor wreck
tossed up from the awful whirlpool of
battle. Soldiers who lived never forgot the
benediction of his presence that beautiful
day, and more than one fell into his last
sleep with the vision of the fatherly and
sympathetic face of the beloved President
before his dim and closing eyes.</p>

<p>They came to the ward where lay the sick
and wounded Southern prisoners.</p>

<p>“You won’t want to go in there, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
President,” said the young surgeon who
was escorting him, “those are only rebels
in there.”</p>

<p>The President turned and laid his large
hand gently on the shoulder of his escort,
and looked serenely and earnestly into his
eyes.</p>

<p>“You mean,” he said, “that they are
Confederates. I want to see them.”</p>

<p>And so, into the Confederate wards he
went, greeting every sufferer as he passed,
asking after their wants, bringing to all of
them good cheer and hopefulness and helpfulness
as he passed by. One boy of seventeen
said to him:—</p>

<p>“My father knew you, Mr. Lincoln, before
the war. He was killed at Chantilly.
He said to me once: ‘Whatever happens,
don’t you ever believe Abraham Lincoln
guilty of harshness or cruelty.’ I am so
glad to have told you that, Mr. Lincoln,
before I die.”</p>

<p>And Lincoln, as he pushed back the damp
hair from the boy’s forehead, and inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the father’s name, and saw the death pallor
already stealing into the young face, said:—</p>

<p>“Thank you, my son. If I know my own
heart, there has never been harshness or
cruelty in it; there is no malice or bitterness
in it to-day. I sympathize with you. I sympathize
with all of you—” he lifted his
head and looked around on the rapt faces
turned toward him—“the more because
your cause is a lost cause, because you are
suffering also the bitterness of defeat. And
yet I feel that, under God, this very defeat
will prove the salvation of your beloved
South.”</p>

<p>And so he passed on. When he came to
the cot where Rhett Bannister was lying,
he gave him a word of simple greeting and
would have gone by had not something in
the man’s face attracted his attention and
caused him to stop.</p>

<p>“Have I ever seen you before?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. President. I am Rhett Bannister
from Pennsylvania. I spent a half-hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
with you one morning in the Secretary’s
room in the War Department, in the
fall of ’63. I was an escaped conscript that
morning.”</p>

<p>A smile of recognition lit up the face of
the President, and his gnarled hand grasped
the hand of the wounded man.</p>

<p>“I remember,” he said. “I remember
very well. And have you been in the service
ever since?”</p>

<p>Some one across the aisle, who had heard
the conversation, replied that time for
Bannister.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. President, he has. And he’s
been the bravest and the best soldier in the
ranks, bar none. I’m the adjutant of his
battalion, and I know.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the President. “Oh,
that’s very good. I felt that we’d make a
good soldier of him in the end. And, let’s
see! There was a boy whose place you
took. The boy went home.”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. President, he wouldn’t go,
so we both stayed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“The boy wouldn’t go home? What
became of him?”</p>

<p>“He’s here, Mr. President, on the next
cot. We were both clipped at Five Forks.”</p>

<p>The President turned half round and
looked incredulously on the pale face of
the youth at his side. Then he took the
boy’s two hands in both of his, and bent
over him. There was no grace in the movement,
there was no beauty of face or
smoothness of diction to add charm to
the incident; but Bob Bannister will remember
to his last hour on earth how the
great War President leaned over him and
spoke.</p>

<p><a href="#image01">“My boy, of such stuff are patriots and
heroes made.”</a></p>

<p>Then, glancing at the wall where Bob’s
frayed and dusty coat hung at the head
of his cot, with the shoulder-straps of a
first lieutenant half showing, he said, inquiringly:—</p>

<p>“That coat’s not yours?”</p>

<p>“It is mine, Mr. President.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Lincoln looked down again at the boyish
face beneath him.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to believe,” he said.</p>

<p>And then the adjutant across the aisle
spoke up for the second time.</p>

<p>“It’s quite true, Mr. President. And he
has splendidly earned every step of his
promotion.”</p>

<p>Still holding the boy’s hands and looking
down into his face, the President said:—</p>

<p>“I thank you, my son. In the name of
the country for which you have fought and
suffered, I thank you.”</p>

<p>After a moment he added:—</p>

<p>“And, let me see, there was a mother
back there in Pennsylvania, wasn’t there?
How’s the mother?”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Lincoln, and waiting
patiently for us.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re going home to her very
soon now. The mothers are going to have
their reward. The war is almost over now,
my boy—it’s almost over, Bannister. Peace
is coming, next week maybe, next month for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
sure. And the peace that’s coming was
well worth fighting for. I tell you the
mothers have not agonized in vain, the dead
have not died for naught.”</p>

<p>There were tears in his eyes as he spoke.
He never could quite get over his pity for
the mothers whose boys had died in the
conflict, nor his sorrow over the unnumbered
lives lost in the maelstrom of war. These
things lay, always, a mighty burden on his
heart. He lived with them by day and he
dreamed of them at night. But now that
there were to be no more battles, no more
agonies, no more dead faces turned upward
to the sky, a thankfulness such as no other
life has ever known filled his soul and suffused
his countenance. Rhett Bannister,
who had seen him in the dark days of ’63,
and who had ever since been haunted by
the inexpressible sadness of his face, noted
at once how that face had been transfigured.
Not that it bore evidence now of pride or
exultation, or a selfish joy in victories
achieved, but rather that it shone with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
great gladness because the sufferings and
the hardships and the heart-agonies of a
whole nation were so near their end. After
a little he loosed one of Bob’s hands and
took one of Bannister’s.</p>

<p>“Good-by, boys!” he said, “and health
to you, and a happy home-going. Some
day you’ll come to Washington. Come in
and see me. I’ll be waiting for you. Good-by!”</p>

<p>He passed down the aisle, tall, loose-jointed,
with ill-fitting clothes and awkward
mien; but to those two wounded
soldiers on their cots it seemed that a more
beautiful presence than his had never
passed their way.</p>

<p>Wounds heal rapidly when light hearts
and clean living add their measure of assistance
to the surgeon’s skill. And so it came
about that both Bannister and his son were
discharged from the hospital a week later.
With the surgeon’s certificates in their pockets,
they were ready to start toward the
North, toward home, toward the sweetest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
most life-giving spot in all the world. They
would not need to come back, they knew
that, for the war was practically over.
Richmond had fallen, Lee had surrendered,
Johnston’s army would soon be in the hands
of Sherman, there was no more fighting to
be done. So they went on board a transport
one day, and rode down the James
and up the Potomac to Washington. It
was early in the evening when they reached
the city, and after a good meal and a refreshing
rest they went out on the streets
for a short stroll before retiring. They were
to leave Washington on an early train the
next morning, and they thought to get a
glimpse of it this night in its holiday attire,
as it might be many years before either of
them would come that way again.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful spring night. The
air was soft, and heavy with the scent of
blossoming lilacs. The night before, the
city had been splendidly illuminated in
honor of the recent victories and the dawn
of peace, and to-night the rejoicings were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
still going on. The crowds that filled the
streets were happy, high-spirited, exultant.
Oh, but it was a different city from the one
through which Bob Bannister went, on
his way to war, in the fall of ’63! Then
gloom, anxiety, was on the face of every
person who went hurrying by; despondency
in the slow gait of every loiterer on the
streets. And over the head of the Chief
Magistrate hung ever the horror of blood,
on his heart weighed ever the apprehension
of unforeseen disaster. But to-night,
how different! Some one who had seen the
President that day said he had not been so
happy, so contented, so tender and serene,
since he had been in Washington. His son
Captain Robert Lincoln had come up from
the South and spent the morning with him.
Some friends from the West had occupied
his joyful attention for a brief time in the
afternoon. All who saw him that day never
afterward forgot the peaceful and gentle
serenity of his face. He had said to the
members of his Cabinet at their meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
that morning, that, on his part, there was
no feeling of hate or vindictiveness toward
any person of the South. That, so far as
he could control it, now that the war was
over, there should be no persecution, no
more bloody work of any kind. That resentment
must give way and be extinguished,
and harmony and union must prevail.</p>

<p>As Bannister and his son walked through
the gay crowds on the streets that night,
they heard people say that the President
and Mrs. Lincoln had gone with a small
party to see the play, “Our American
Cousin,” at Ford’s Theatre on Tenth Street.
It was a time for relaxation and pleasure,
and the President wanted the people to
feel that he rejoiced with them. When the
play should be over, there would be a
crowd waiting at the door of the play-house
to see the Chief Magistrate come out and
enter his carriage, and to show their admiration
and love for him by cheers and
huzzas and the waving of hats and handkerchiefs.
The theatre was not far away, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Bannister and Bob thought to go there and
take part in the demonstration. F Street,
along which they were walking, was almost
deserted. The crowds had gravitated down
into E Street and beyond, and were thronging
Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>

<p>Bob looked at his watch,—the boys of
his company had sent it to him as a memento
before he left the hospital,—and
saw that it was nearly half-past ten.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll have to hurry a little,
father,” he said, “the play must be nearly
over now.”</p>

<p>So they quickened their steps. Between
Tenth and Eleventh Streets, as they hurried
along, a strange thing happened. As
they passed the mouth of an alley leading
to the centre of the block, toward E Street,
their attention was attracted by an unusual
noise proceeding from the depths of the
passageway. Some one down there was
shouting and cursing. Then there was a
clatter of horse’s hoofs on the cobblestone
pavement; around the corner of a building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and into the light of the dim lamp hung at
the foot of the alley, clanging up the passage
and dashing out into the street, came
a man on horseback. He was hatless, wild-eyed,
terrible in countenance and mien.
In one hand he held his horse’s rein, in the
other he grasped a dagger, shining in the
moonlight at the hilt, stained with blood
on the blade. Heading his horse to the
north, bending forward in his saddle, his
long, dark hair flying out behind him, he
went, in a mad gallop, up the half-deserted
street, and, before the astonished onlookers
had fairly caught breath, he had vanished
into the night. A half-dozen men, strolling
along in that vicinity, turned and gazed after
the flying horseman, and then all, with one
accord, involuntarily started in the direction
he had taken. At the corner of Tenth
Street, as they looked down toward Ford’s
Theatre, they saw that there was some
confusion there. Men were running toward
the play-house, other men were pushing their
passage from its doorway. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
shouts which Bannister and his son could
not understand, but they, with the others,
ran down toward the centre of the disturbance.
Before they were able to reach the
front of the theatre, the cry came, loud and
clear, so that all could hear it:—</p>

<p>“Lincoln has been shot!”</p>

<p>And again:—</p>

<p>“The President has been killed!”</p>

<p>One man, white-faced, bareheaded,
rushed from the doorway of the theatre
crying:—</p>

<p>“Stop the assassin! Stop him! It was
Wilkes Booth. Don’t let him get away!”</p>

<p>But those who had seen the flying horseman
disappear down the long moonlit vista
of F Street, knew that the assassin had already
made his escape.</p>

<p>Men and women, with horror-stricken
faces, were now pouring from the entrance
to the play-house. The street was filling
up with a jostling, questioning, gesticulating
crowd. “How did it happen?”—“Who
did it?”—“Why was it done?”—“Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
is the murderer?”—“Catch him!”—“Hang
him!” Men demanded information,
and action as well. Two soldiers in
full uniform, with side-arms, hurled themselves
out into the roadway, through the
crowd, and up toward F Street. Some one
called a boy and told him to run to the
White House as though his life were the
forfeit for delay, and tell Robert Lincoln
to come.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, a hush fell upon the
crowd. It was known that they were bringing
the President down. The space about
the doorway was cleared, and out into the
lamplight came men bearing the long, limp
body of Abraham Lincoln. At the sidewalk
they hesitated and stopped. What
should they do with him? There was no
carriage there. And if there had been, it
was too long and rough a journey to the
White House to take a dying man. Diagonally
across the street, on the high front
porch of a plain three-story dwelling-house,
a young man stood. He had come from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
his bed-chamber to learn the cause of the
disturbance, and seeing the limp body of
the President brought from the door of the
theatre, and that the bearers were in doubt
as to what they should do, he called out
across the street, over the heads of the
multitude:—</p>

<p>“Bring him in here! Bring him in here!”</p>

<p>And the men who were carrying the body,
having no plan of their own, knowing nothing
better to do, bore their unconscious
burden across the way, up the steep and
winding stairs to the porch, through the
modest doorway and down the narrow hall
into a small plain sleeping-room at the
end, and laid the President of the United
States on a bed where a soldier of the ranks,
home on furlough, had slept for many
nights.</p>

<p>And it was there that the President died.
Not in the White House with its stately
halls and ornate rooms, not where his labor
had been done and his cares had weighed
him down, not where his hours of anguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
had been spent and his tears of pity had
been shed; but here, in this humble home,
like the homes he had loved and lived in
before the nation called him for its chief,
it was here, in the gray of the next morning,
that he died. And Stanton, his great
War Secretary, standing at his bedside
when the last breath left the mortal body,
Stanton who had known him for many
years, who had in turn denounced him,
ridiculed him, criticised him, honored him,
and loved him, turned in that moment
to the awe-stricken onlookers at the last
scene and said: “Now he is with the
ages.”</p>

<p>Among those lining the pathway across
the street along which the President’s body
was borne, dripping blood as it passed,
stood Rhett Bannister and his son. For
one moment, as the moonlight fell on the
gray face, already stamped with the seal
of death, they saw him. His long arms
hung loosely at his sides, his eyes were
closed, his countenance showed no mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of suffering, save that some one, holding
his wounded head, had inadvertently
smeared his cheek with blood. They never
forgot that sight. They never could forget
it. Many and many a time, in the stillness
of midnight, in the light and noise of noonday,
no matter where or when, the vision
of that face they both had known and loved,
with its closed eyes and tangled hair, and
with the blood-splash on the cheek, came
back to them, with its never-ending shock
and sorrow.</p>

<p>After the President’s body had passed,
and the crowd closed in again, and men
took second thought and began to realize
the horror of the hour, and to rave against
the assassin, and those who might have influenced
him, and while women, pale-faced
and unbonneted, wept and wrung their
hands, the soldiers came and cleared the
theatre, and drove the people from the
street; and thenceforward, until the dead
body of the Chief Magistrate had been
borne from the humble house where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
died, no one without authority was permitted
to pass that way.</p>

<p>Rhett Bannister and Bob were pushed
and crowded back with the rest up into
F Street, along which they had been quietly
strolling a half-hour earlier, and there,
exhausted from the shock of the tragedy,
grief-stricken as they had never been before,
they sat down on the street curb to rest.
And, even as they sat there, men came running
by calling out that Secretary of State
Seward had been stabbed in his bed, and
that every member of the Cabinet had been
marked for murder.</p>

<p>“Father,” said Bob, when he found his
voice to speak, “what does it all mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Robert, except that the
most inhuman and uncalled-for crime that
ever marred the centuries has been committed
this night.”</p>

<p>“Father, I can’t go home. While such
things as these are still possible I wouldn’t
dare go home, there’s more work for us to
do yet in the army. I am going back to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
morning to join my regiment in
Virginia.”</p>

<p>“You are right, my son, and I will go
back with you.”</p>

<p>And they went.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THE WELCOME HOME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The war was over. Peace rested on
the land. All men, North and South,
were thankful that the shedding of human
blood had ceased. June came, brighter,
more beautiful, than any other June of
which living men had memory. The world
was filled with sunshine, with flowers, with
the songs of birds, with the flashings of
waters, with the gladness of nature and humanity.
The last tired, tattered soldier of
the South had gone back to his home to
pick up the broken threads of destiny and
to begin his life anew. And, slowly drifting
up from camp and battle-field, the veterans
of the Union army were coming by ones and
twos and in little groups, some of them mere
ghosts of the boys who had gone to the front
when the war was on. But for every war-worn
soldier thus returning there was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
who would never come again. So there
were tears as well as smiles, and heart-aches
as well as rejoicings.</p>

<p>But the soldiers from Mount Hermon
did not come until after the close of the
Grand Review in Washington, in which
they took part. Then they too turned their
faces toward home. It was agreed that they
should all come together. And Mount
Hermon, that had sent them forth with its
God-speed, that had rejoiced in their victories
and sorrowed in their defeats, was
ready to welcome them back. They were
to come on a special car that would reach
Carbon Creek late in the forenoon. There
they were to be met by a committee of welcome,
with a band of music and decorated
wagons. The party would reach Mount
Hermon about noon, and after the first
greetings had been given, there was to be a
dinner under a great tent on the public
square, the finest dinner that the men of
Mount Hermon could buy and the women
of Mount Hermon could prepare. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
after the dinner, from the platform at the
end of the tent, there were to be addresses
of welcome, and music, and every returning
man and boy who had worn the blue
was to be made to feel that the town was
proud of him this day, and honored him
for the service he had performed for his
country and the lustre he had shed upon
Mount Hermon.</p>

<p>So, on the day of the arrival, the committee
of welcome was at Carbon Creek a
full hour before the train was due, so fearful
were they lest by some unforeseen delay
they should be one minute too late. In due
time the procession, half a hundred strong,
started on its way to Mount Hermon, the
band in the first wagon playing “Marching
through Georgia.” All along the route
there was, as the newspapers said next day,
“a continuous ovation.” Farm-houses were
decorated, flags were flying everywhere,
groups of cheering citizens stood at every
crossroad. When they reached the borough
line, they all descended from the wagons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and formed on foot to march to the village
green. Not quite as they had formed in
other days under Southern skies, for now
there was no one in command; officers and
privates alike were in the ranks to-day,
marching shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm,
in one long, glad, home-coming procession.
But you couldn’t keep those ranks in order;
no one could have kept them in order. One
old veteran said that Ulysses Grant himself
couldn’t have kept the men in line, there
was so much cheering, so much hand-shaking,
so many waiting wives and mothers
and children to be kissed and hugged and
kissed again. And long before the great
tent on the green was reached there was no
more semblance of order in those happy
ranks, than you would have found among a
group of schoolgirls out for a holiday.</p>

<p>Private Bannister and his son were both
in the procession. Not that it was Rhett
Bannister’s choice to be there. He had
thought to make the journey back to his
home quietly and alone, in much the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
way that he had left it nearly two years before,
and there await such welcome, good
or ill, as the people of the community might
see fit to give him. But his comrades simply
would not have it so. Indeed, they refused
absolutely to go together, or to partake in
the ceremony of welcome, unless he would
go with them. So he went, not without
many misgivings, fearing the worst, yet
hoping for the best. And the best came.
His record in the ranks had preceded him
long before. The story of his conversion by
Abraham Lincoln was a story that his
neighbors never wearied of telling. And if
there was one thing more than another on
which Mount Hermon prided herself, next
to having as one of her own boys the youngest
commissioned officer in the Army of the
Potomac, it was on the fact that Rhett
Bannister, the once hated, despised, and
outlawed copperhead, had become one of
the best and bravest and truest soldiers in
the armies of his country.</p>

<p>And so Mount Hermon welcomed him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Nor could he for one moment doubt the
sincerity of his welcome. The hearty handclasp,
the trembling voice, the tear-dimmed
eye with which old friends and neighbors
greeted him, left no room for questionings.</p>

<p>One block from the public square Henry
Bradbury came upon them. He put his one
remaining arm around Bob’s shoulders and
hugged him till he winced.</p>

<p>“You rascal!” he exclaimed. “You
runaway! You patriot! God bless you!”</p>

<p>Then he released Bob, and grasped Bob’s
father’s hand.</p>

<p>“Rhett Bannister,” he said, “I never
took hold of but one man’s hand in my life
before, that I was prouder to shake, and
that was Abraham Lincoln’s.”</p>

<p>Then when he got his voice again, he
added:—</p>

<p>“Fall out, both of you. Sarah Jane
Stark wants to see you at her house before
you go to the square.”</p>

<p>So they followed him three blocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
around, and down to the house of Sarah
Jane Stark. She was there in the hall,
waiting for them.</p>

<p>“Bob Bannister,” she said, “I love you!”
And she put her hands up on his broad
shoulders and kissed him on both cheeks.
Then she turned to Bob’s father, and,
without a word, and much to his amazement
and confusion, she saluted him in the
same way.</p>

<p>“There!” she exclaimed, “that’s the
first time I’ve kissed a man in forty years. I
never expect to kiss another, but—to-day—it’s
worth it. There, not a word! I
know what I’m doing. Go in there, both of
you. March!”</p>

<p>She opened the parlor door, thrust them
both into the room, and closed the door on
them without another word. In that room
were Mary Bannister and Louise. At the
end of fifteen minutes, Sarah Jane Stark
came back down the hall and knocked
briskly.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said, “it’s time to go to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
square. You needn’t think you can stay
here and make love all day. And I won’t
give you a thing to eat. You’ve got to go up
to the tent and eat with the rest of us.”</p>

<p>On the way up she walked with Bob. She
had a thousand questions to ask, nor could
Bob get one quite answered before a new
one would strike him squarely between the
eyes. But when she said: “And where’s
that dear sergeant who took breakfast
with us one morning, and who couldn’t
say grace; what became of him?” and
Bob answered, “He was killed at Cold
Harbor, Miss Stark,” she was silent for a
full minute.</p>

<p>They were just ready to sit down to dinner
in the big tent when the Bannisters arrived.
A place had been reserved for them
at the head of the table, two and two on
each side of the master of the feast, with all
the other veterans and their wives and
daughters and sweethearts in line below,
and the patriotic citizens of Mount Hermon
filling up the rest of the long tables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>That was a dinner! In the whole history
of Mount Hermon nothing had been known
to equal it. And when it was over, and the
tables had been partly cleared, the flag at
the end of the tent was drawn aside, and
there on the platform were the speakers,
the singers, and the band. A chorus of
girls, dressed in white, with little flags in
their hands, sang “America.” There was
a brief and fervent prayer by the old clergyman
who had married nearly every one’s
father and mother in Mount Hermon, and
who knew all the middle-aged people by
their first names. Then the burgess of the
borough delivered the address of welcome,
and the band played. After that the chairman
of the meeting rose and rapped for
order.</p>

<p>“Our young friends,” he said, “desire to
participate, to a brief extent, in this programme
of rejoicing. I will call upon
Master Samuel Powers.”</p>

<p>So Master Samuel Powers made his way
awkwardly and blushingly up between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
benches and tables, to the platform. At
the steps he stumbled, recovered himself
with a masterly jerk, and continued on his
course. Turning to the audience, red-faced
and frightened, he began to search in his
pockets for something that he had evidently
mislaid. Into his coat pockets and trousers
pockets, each side in turn, outside and inside,
he searched with increasing desperation,
but in vain. Then he tried the pockets
all over again, with the same result. The
audience began to see the comical side of
the boy’s embarrassment, and half-suppressed
laughter was heard throughout the
tent. Some one in the crowd yelled:—</p>

<p>“Cough it up, Sam! cough it up! You’ve
swallered it!”</p>

<p>And a boy’s voice somewhere in the rear
responded:—</p>

<p>“Aw, snakes! Let ’im alone. He’s got it
in his head. Give it to ’em, Sammy, boy!
Chuck it at ’em! Go it!”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Sam advanced to the
front of the platform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had a paper,” he said, “to read from,
but I guess I’ve lost it. Anyway, what I
want to say is that two years ago us boys
had a military company here. An’ we’ve
got it yet. An’ we’re goin’ to keep it. Well,
two years ago Bob Bannister tried to get in
the company an’ we wouldn’t let ’im in
because—” he gave a frightened glance at
Rhett Bannister, sitting below him—“I
might as well tell—because his father was
a copperhead. Well, after what happened
we got a little ashamed of ourselves, an’
when we heard how he was fightin’ down
there in a real company, we were all sorry
we hadn’t let him in. So when our captain
moved away we elected Bob Bannister
captain, with leave of absence till the war
was over. But somehow or another that
didn’t seem to be quite enough to do. An’
then when we heard about Five Forks we
got together an’ chipped in, and our fathers
helped us a little, and we bought him the
best sword an’ silk sash that Henry Bradbury
could find in New York, an’ we want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
to give it to him here to-day. Say, Bill
Hinkle, bring that sword up here!”</p>

<p>Thunders of applause greeted Sam’s
remarks. Some one took Bob by the arm
and dragged him to the platform, and when
he had received the sword, which was indeed
a beauty, there were insistent calls for
a speech. Bob looked down to his father
for help and inspiration, and as he did so
the audience saw on his head the long, red,
ragged scar over which the hair had not
yet grown, and then the applause was renewed
with threefold vehemence.</p>

<p>Finally he managed to stammer out:—</p>

<p>“I can’t make a speech. I’m sure this
tribute from the boys has touched my
heart. I know I’m very grateful to you all
for the way you’ve welcomed me. I’ll
never forget this day, and—and I guess
that’s all.”</p>

<p>He turned and made a rapid retreat from
the platform, while the audience shouted
itself hoarse with approval of his speech.
There was more music by the band, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
then Judge Morgan mounted the platform.
He had aged much during the last two years
of the war, and his hand trembled visibly as
he thrust it, after the old fashion, into the
breast of his tightly buttoned Prince Albert
coat. But his voice, though quavering a
little at the start, was still strong and penetrating,
and no one in the audience could
fail to hear him as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, returning soldiers of the
Union armies, ladies and fellow citizens:—</p>

<p>“Some two years ago it was my fortune,
or misfortune as you choose, to be present
at a meeting of the citizens of Mount Hermon,
held on the nation’s natal day, on this
very spot. The great battle of Gettysburg
had just been fought. Public feeling ran
high, the spirit of patriotism was at white
heat. It became my duty to draw and
present to that meeting a set of resolutions
condemnatory of one of our fellow citizens
whose unpatriotic attitude and open disloyalty
brought down upon his head our
righteous wrath. I need not repeat those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
resolutions here. I need not call your attention
further to the exciting incidents of
that day. Many of you will remember them.
I will hasten on to say that it has been my
duty and my great pleasure to prepare
another set of resolutions to be presented to
this meeting to-day. They are as follows:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Resolved</span>: <em>First</em>,—That the resolutions
heretofore adopted by the citizens of
Mount Hermon on the fourth day of
July, <span class="lcsmcaps">A. D.</span> 1863, denouncing as disloyal and
unworthy of citizenship one Rhett Bannister,
be and they are hereby absolutely
suspended, revoked, and made void.</p>

<p>“<em>Second</em>,—That we welcome the said
Rhett Bannister to his home as he returns
to us from the war, bringing with him a
record for loyalty and courage of which the
best and bravest soldier might well be
proud. And we congratulate him and his
noble wife on the splendid service which
their son Lieutenant Robert Barnwell Bannister
has rendered to his country in her
hour of need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>Third</em>,—That we welcome with open
arms and thankful hearts all these soldiers
of the Republic, who have returned to us
this day bearing laurels of victory, and we
extend our assistance and condolence to
all sick and wounded veterans and to all
widows and orphans through whose sufferings
our country has been saved.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, I move the adoption of
these resolutions by a rising vote.”</p>

<p>And how they did vote! rising of course,
standing on chairs, tables, anything; cheering,
waving hats and handkerchiefs, to express
their approval of the resolutions
which Judge Morgan had so acceptably
framed. Then there were shouts for “Bannister!
Rhett Bannister! Rhett Bannister!”</p>

<p>At first he did not want to go. Then, as
the second and wiser thought came to him,
<a href="#image08">he</a> mounted the platform and <a href="#image08">faced his
fellow townsmen</a>. In the beginning he
could not quite control his voice, but it soon
got back its old resonant ring, and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
audience sat in rapt attention, listening to
his words.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 510px;">

<p>“My friends and neighbors, I do not deserve
this. I never dreamed of a welcome
home like this. I thought to come back
quietly, alone, and slip as easily as I might
into the old grooves, and I hoped that some
day, possibly, you would forget. But the
boys who marched with me, fought with
me, suffered with me, not one of whom but
has been braver, truer, more faithful, and
more deserving than I,—the boys, I say,
would not listen to it. So here I am, with
them—and you. And now that I am here
I want to say to you what I have had it in
my heart to say to you, night and day, for
nearly two years. I am, as you know, descended
from the men and women of the
South. When the war came on I sympathized
with my brothers there. If I had
been resident among them then, and had
failed to rally to their cause, I would have
been more than a poltroon. I could not see
that the environment of a lifetime here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
should have led me into wiser counsels and
better judgment. You know the story of my
folly. But, like Saul of Tarsus, breathing out
threatenings and slaughter, I came one day
into the presence of an overmastering soul.
I went out from that presence changed, and
utterly subdued. I saw things in a new light
and with a larger vision. Not that I loved
my people of the South any less, but that I
loved my country more. By the grace and
mercy of Abraham Lincoln, and the goodness
of God, I was permitted to fight in the
ranks of my country’s soldiers, side by side
with my son whom you have just seen and
heard. I never commended this boy publicly
before, and it is not probable that I
ever shall again; but I will say to-day, that
no knight of old ever sought the Holy Grail
with more persistent courage and deeper
devotion than he has sought his country’s
welfare. As for me, I am what I am to-day,
I have done what I have done, because of
Abraham Lincoln. If you had seen him as
I saw him, if you had heard him as I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
him, you would have loved him as I loved
him—yet not so deeply. For my love was
greater because he loved my people of the
South. Doubt me if you will, discredit me
if you must, but I speak what I believe and
know when I say that the men and women
of the South have never had a better friend,
a truer guide, a wiser counselor, than they
lost when the foul assassin’s bullet sent this
gentle spirit to its home. I have done what
I could. I have been the best soldier I
knew how to be. Now I am back with you,
to take up once more the old life, and to try
to prove to you through all the days and
nights that are to come, that your flag is my
flag, that your country is my country, and
that this home among the Pennsylvania
hills was never quite so dear to me before
as it is to-day. I thank you. I am grateful
to you all. Your welcome has touched me
so deeply—so deeply”—and then his
voice went utterly to pieces, and with tears
of joy streaming down his face, he left the
stand.</p>

<p>The meeting did not last long after that.
There were more numbers on the programme
indeed. But when Rhett Bannister
had finished, so many were talking, so
many were cheering, so many were crying,
that the chairman simply let the people
have their own way and finish as they
would.</p>

<p>It was a happy supper-party at the Bannister
home that night; so like the suppers
in the summer days of old, in the years before
the war. After it was over, Bob went
down by the path across the meadow, as he
used to go, to see Seth Mills. The old man
had failed much of late. Age was resting
heavily upon him, and he was too feeble to
go far from home.</p>

<p>And in the beautiful June twilight Rhett
Bannister sat upon his porch and looked
out upon the old familiar scene: the fields,
the trees, the road, the clear and wonderful
expanse of sky. But when his eyes wandered,
for a moment, to the shop and the
windmill tower crowned by the motionless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
blades of the big wheel, he turned them
away. There were things which, on this
night of nights, he did not care to bring
back to memory. And, as he sat there,
holding in his own the hand of the happiest,
proudest woman that the stars looked
down upon that summer night in all the
old Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, there
came the well-remembered click of the
front-gate latch, and, out of the darkness,
hobbling slowly up the walk, came the bent
figure of Seth Mills. Bannister leaped from
the porch and hurried down the path to
meet him. The old man stopped and looked
him over in well-feigned dismay.</p>

<p>“Rhett Bannister,” he exclaimed, “you
blamed ol’ copperhead! you skallywag deserter!
you deep-dyed villyan! what ’a you
wearin’ them blue soldier clothes fur?”</p>

<p>Then, as Bannister hesitated, in doubt
as to how he should take this outburst, his
visitor broke into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, Rhett,” he said, “I forgive you. I
forgive you. Where’s your hand? Where’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
your two hands? I knowed what you’d do
when the boy went. I told him so. God
bless you, but I’m proud of you! I’m
proud o’ both of you! Bob’s been down;
splendid boy; said I mustn’t come up here;
too fur to walk. I told him to mind his own
business; that I was comin’ up to shake
hands with Rhett Bannister ef it took a leg;
ef it took both legs, by cracky!”</p>

<p>Bannister helped the old man up the
steps, and made him comfortable in a big
porch-chair, and told him a hundred things
he wanted to know, and at last he told him
about Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>“You know I saw the President?”</p>

<p>“I heard all about it, Rhett. You’ve
been blessed above your fellow men.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t know that he spoke to
me of you?”</p>

<p>“Of me? Seth Mills?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of you. He told me that story about
how you settled the spring controversy with
Sam Lewis.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, he did. And then I told him that
I knew you, that you were my nearest and
best neighbor; and he said: ‘You tell Seth
Mills for me, if you ever see him again, that
Abe Lincoln remembers him, and sends
him greeting and good wishes in memory of
the old days in Sangamon County.’ I’ve
carried that message in my heart for you
through blood and fire, Seth, and now, to-night,
it is yours.”</p>

<p>But the old man did not reply. Instead,
his hand stole out and rested on his neighbor’s
knee, and then, softly in the darkness,
Bannister heard him sob.</p>

<p>But Seth Mills went home at last, and
over the crest of the eastern hill-range the
full moon came shining. And then something
else happened. From the shadows of
the roadway that fronted the house, suddenly,
sweetly, jubilantly on the night air,
came the music of a chorus of fresh young
voices singing:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Home, home, sweet, sweet home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be it ever so humble, there’s no place like home.”<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>They were the same boys who, two years
before, had marched down the road at
night singing songs of derision to the hated
copperhead.</p>

<p>Ah! but those two years. What may not
happen in a time like that? What change
of thought, of heart, of life? What tragedy
and transformation?</p>

<p>As the faint, sweet chorus of the boy-singers
came back to him across the moonlit
fields, Rhett Bannister turned his face
to the star-strewn sky, and thanked God
that after the storm and stress and trial,
and through the ministry of one great man,
he had fallen upon such glorious days.</p>
